### ⚠️ What's Partially Working

#### Analytics (40%)
- ✅ Framework exists in `src/lib/analytics.ts`
- ✅ Methods: `page()`, `track()`, `identify()`
- ⚠️ **Missing**: No provider integration (PostHog, Plausible, Google Analytics)
- ⚠️ **Impact**: Can't measure user behavior or conversions

**Action Required:**
```typescript
// TODO: Integrate analytics provider
// Option 1: PostHog
import posthog from 'posthog-js';
posthog.capture(event, properties);

// Option 2: Plausible
plausible(event, { props: properties });
```

#### Dark Mode (70%)
- ✅ `next-themes` package installed
- ⚠️ **Missing**: ThemeProvider wrapper not in App.tsx
- ⚠️ **Missing**: Theme toggle component not visible

**Action Required:**
```typescript
// Add to App.tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system">
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### Pitch Deck Wizard AI (10%)
- ✅ Page exists: `PitchDeckWizard.tsx`
- ✅ Database table: `pitch_conversations`
- ✅ SDK installed: `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
- ⚠️ **Blocked**: No Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`
- ⚠️ **Blocked**: No agent implementation (content_agent, slides_agent)

**Evidence of Block:**
```bash
# ⚠️ Empty directory
ls supabase/functions/
# Result: Directory does not exist or is empty
```

#### Environment Management (70%)
- ✅ `.env.example` comprehensive template
- ✅ Variables documented with warnings
- ⚠️ **Missing**: No production `.env` configuration guidance
- ⚠️ **Missing**: No environment validation script

---

### 🔴 Critical Gaps

#### AI & Agent Layer (14%)
**Status:** 🔴 **Blocked** — Cannot proceed without backend setup

**Missing Components:**
1. **No Edge Functions**: `supabase/functions/` is empty
2. **No Agent Implementation**: No `content_agent.py`, `slides_agent.py`
3. **No Supervisor**: No multi-agent orchestration
4. **No CopilotKit Integration**: SDK installed but not used

**Impact:**
- Pitch Deck Wizard is non-functional
- AI-powered features unavailable
- Core differentiator missing

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Create Edge Function
supabase functions new pitch-deck-assistant

# 2. Implement agents (see pitch-deck/tasks/04-CONTENT-AGENT.md)

# 3. Deploy function
supabase functions deploy pitch-deck-assistant
```

#### Testing Infrastructure (20%)
**Status:** 🔴 **Critical** — No automated testing in place

**Missing:**
- No E2E tests (despite Playwright setup)
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No CI/CD pipeline

**Impact:**
- Manual testing only
- High regression risk
- Slow deployment confidence

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Create E2E tests
mkdir e2e
touch e2e/auth.spec.ts
touch e2e/events.spec.ts

# 2. Add CI/CD
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/test.yml

# 3. Run tests
pnpm test
```

#### User Roles System (0%)
**Status:** 🔴 **Security Risk** — No role-based access control

**Missing:**
- No `user_roles` table
- No `app_role` enum
- No `has_role()` function for RLS policies

**Impact:**
- Cannot differentiate admin from regular users
- No organizer vs attendee distinction
- Security vulnerability

**Required Actions:**
```sql
-- 1. Create role enum
CREATE TYPE public.app_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'user', 'organizer');

-- 2. Create user_roles table
CREATE TABLE public.user_roles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role app_role NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE (user_id, role)
);

-- 3. Create secure function
CREATE FUNCTION has_role(_user_id UUID, _role app_role)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = _user_id AND role = _role
  )
$$;
```

#### Docker Setup (0%)
**Status:** 🔴 **Ops Risk** — No containerization

**Missing:**
- No `Dockerfile`
- No `docker-compose.yml`
- No consistent development environment

**Impact:**
- Environment inconsistencies
- Difficult onboarding
- Deployment complexity

#### Search & Notifications (0%)
**Status:** 🔴 **UX Gap** — Key features missing

**Missing:**
- No global search (events, jobs, startups)
- No notification system (email, in-app)
- No real-time updates

**Impact:**
- Poor discoverability
- Low user engagement
- Missed opportunities

## 🚨 Critical Blockers

### 1. AI Layer Completely Missing
**Severity:** 🔴 **Critical**  
**Impact:** Core feature (Pitch Deck Wizard) non-functional

**Blockers:**
- `supabase/functions/` directory empty
- No agent implementations
- No CopilotKit integration

**Resolution Path:**
1. Follow `pitch-deck/tasks/README.md`
2. Complete Task 04-06 (Content Agent → Slides Agent → Supervisor)
3. Deploy Edge Functions
4. Wire up frontend to backend

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

---

### 2. No Automated Testing
**Severity:** 🔴 **Critical**  
**Impact:** High regression risk, slow deployments

**Blockers:**
- `e2e/` directory empty
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No test coverage

**Resolution Path:**
1. Create Playwright tests (smoke, auth, pitch-deck-wizard)
2. Set up GitHub Actions workflow
3. Run tests on every PR

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### 3. No User Roles System
**Severity:** 🔴 **Security**  
**Impact:** Cannot implement role-based features

**Blockers:**
- No `user_roles` table
- No admin panel
- No role checking in RLS policies

**Resolution Path:**
1. Run migration to create `user_roles` table
2. Update RLS policies to use `has_role()`
3. Build admin UI

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### 1. Fix AI Layer (Priority: 🔴 Critical)
```bash
# Follow existing documentation
cd pitch-deck/tasks/
cat 04-CONTENT-AGENT.md
cat 05-SLIDES-AGENT.md
cat 06-SUPERVISOR-API.md
```

**Value:** Unlocks core differentiator (AI pitch deck generation)

#### 2. Implement User Roles (Priority: 🔴 Security)
```sql
-- Run migration for user_roles table
-- See detailed SQL above in "Critical Gaps" section
```

**Value:** Enables admin features, improves security

#### 3. Create Basic E2E Tests (Priority: 🔴 Quality)
```typescript
// e2e/smoke.spec.ts
test('homepage loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Medellín AI');
});
```

**Value:** Catches regressions, enables CI/CD

---

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 4. Integrate Analytics Provider
**Options:** PostHog (best for startups), Plausible (privacy-focused)

```bash
pnpm add posthog-js
```

**Value:** Data-driven decisions, conversion tracking

#### 5. Add Search Functionality
**Options:** Supabase full-text search, Algolia, Meilisearch

```sql
-- Enable full-text search
CREATE INDEX events_search_idx ON events 
USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description));
```

**Value:** Improved discoverability, better UX

#### 6. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm test
```

**Value:** Automated quality checks, faster deployments

---

### Medium-Term (Next Month)

#### 7. Docker Setup
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN pnpm install
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build
CMD ["pnpm", "preview"]
```

**Value:** Consistent environments, easier deployment

#### 8. Monitoring & Error Tracking
```bash
pnpm add @sentry/react
```

**Value:** Proactive issue detection, better reliability

#### 9. Notification System
**Options:** Supabase Realtime, email via SendGrid/Resend

**Value:** User engagement, retention
