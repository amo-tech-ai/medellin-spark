# üîç Mini Prompt - Examine Setup and Create Plan

Hey Lovable! Before we start building the Pitch Deck AI Generator, I need you to examine what already exists and create a detailed implementation plan.

---

## üìã YOUR TASK

Examine the current Medellin AI Hub setup and create a comprehensive plan for adding an AI-powered pitch deck generator.

---

## STEP 1: EXAMINE THE CURRENT SITE

### 1.1 Scan Existing Pages and Components

Look through the current Medellin AI Hub site and tell me:

**What pages exist?**
- List all the pages you can find (landing, dashboard, profiles, etc.)
- Which pages are public and which require authentication?
- What's the main navigation structure?

**What design patterns are being used?**
- What color scheme does the site use? (primary, secondary, accent colors)
- What button styles exist? (sizes, colors, hover states)
- What card styles are used? (shadows, borders, padding)
- What form components exist? (inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes)
- What typography is used? (heading sizes, body text, small text)

**What components can we reuse?**
- Are there existing button components?
- Are there existing card components?
- Are there existing form input components?
- Are there existing modal or dialog components?
- Are there existing loading indicators?
- What icons or icon library is being used?

**What navigation patterns exist?**
- Is there a sidebar navigation?
- Is there a top navigation bar?
- How do users move between pages?
- What breadcrumbs or back buttons are used?

## STEP 2: EXAMINE THE SUPABASE DATABASE

### 2.1 Connect to Supabase

Connect to the Supabase project and inspect:

**What tables exist?**
- List all tables in the database
- What are the primary keys and foreign keys?
- What relationships exist between tables?

**Focus on the presentations table:**
- What columns does it have?
- What are the data types for each column?
- Are there any JSONB columns? If so, what structure do they use?
- What's the relationship to the profiles table?
- Are there any indexes on the table?

**What about Row Level Security (RLS)?**
- What RLS policies are in place?
- Who can read presentations?
- Who can create/update/delete presentations?

**What Edge Functions exist?**
- Are there any Supabase Edge Functions already created?
- If so, what do they do?
- Are there functions for AI generation?

---

## STEP 3: REVIEW THE REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 Study presentation-ai Structure

Look at `/home/sk/medellin-spark/presentation-ai` and tell me:

**What's the folder structure?**
- How are pages organized? (app router, pages router, or other?)
- Where are components stored?
- How are components organized by feature?
- Where are utilities and helpers stored?
- Where are types and interfaces defined?

**What presentation-related components exist?**
- What components are in the `components/presentation/` folder?
- What are the main page components called?
- What are the editor components called?
- What are the theme components called?
- What's the naming convention for components?

**What's the data flow?**
- How is state managed? (React state, Zustand, Context, other?)
- How do components communicate?
- Where does API calling happen?
- How is the database accessed? (Prisma in their case, Supabase in ours)

**What can we adapt vs skip?**
- What patterns should we follow exactly?
- What can we simplify for MVP?
- What complex features should we skip initially?

---

## STEP 4: CREATE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 4.1 Identify What Needs to Be Built

Based on your examination, create a plan that answers:

**What pages need to be created?**
- List each new page route
- Describe the purpose of each page
- What's the navigation flow between pages?

**What existing pages need to be enhanced?**
- Which pages need modifications?
- What specific changes are needed?
- Can we keep existing functionality?

**What new components need to be created?**
- List all new components needed
- Describe the purpose of each
- What props will they need?
- Which components have dependencies on others?

**What components can be reused from existing Medellin AI?**
- List components that already exist and can be reused
- Will they need any modifications?

**What's missing that we need to build?**
- What backend functions are needed? (Supabase Edge Functions)
- What database changes are needed? (new tables, columns, RLS policies)
- What external APIs need to be integrated? (Claude AI)

### 4.2 Define the User Journey

Map out the complete flow:

**Starting Point:**
- Where does the user begin? (Dashboard, landing page, other?)
- What action triggers the flow?

**Each Step:**
- What page does the user see?
- What actions can they take?
- What happens when they submit/click?
- Where do they go next?
- What data is saved at each step?

**Ending Point:**
- Where does the journey end?
- What has been created/saved?
- Can the user go back and edit?

### 4.3 Identify Potential Challenges

**Technical challenges:**
- What's the most complex component to build?
- Are there any performance concerns?
- What about mobile responsiveness?
- Any state management complexity?

**Integration challenges:**
- How will we call the Claude AI API?
- How will we handle long-running AI generation?
- How will we show progress to users?
- What about error handling?

**Design challenges:**
- How do we match the existing Medellin AI design?
- How do we adopt Decktopus patterns?
- How do we make drag-and-drop intuitive?
- How do we handle auto-save UX?

### 4.4 Propose Build Order

**Suggest a phased approach:**
- What should we build first? Why?
- What should we build second? Why?
- What's the logical order of implementation?
- What can be built in parallel?
- What has dependencies that must be built sequentially?

**Estimate complexity:**
- Which pages are simple to build?
- Which pages are complex?
- Which features might take the most time?
- What's a realistic timeline for MVP?

## STEP 5: DOCUMENT YOUR FINDINGS

### 5.1 Create a Report

Organize your findings into a clear report with these sections:

**Section 1: Current State**
- What exists today
- What works well
- What can be reused

**Section 2: What Needs to Be Built**
- List of new pages
- List of new components
- List of backend needs
- List of database changes

**Section 3: Implementation Plan**
- Phased build approach
- What to build in each phase
- Dependencies between phases
- Estimated timeline

**Section 4: Design Approach**
- How to match existing design
- What Decktopus patterns to adopt
- Color scheme for presentation features
- Component styling guidelines

**Section 5: Data Architecture**
- Database schema details
- JSONB structure for outline and content
- When and where to save data
- RLS policies needed

**Section 6: Potential Risks**
- Technical challenges
- Integration concerns
- Performance considerations
- Mitigation strategies

---

## üìù OUTPUT FORMAT

Please present your findings as a clear, organized report that I can review before we start building.

Use headings, bullet points, and clear descriptions. Be specific about:
- Component names (use presentation-ai naming conventions)
- Route paths (e.g., `/presentations/:id/outline`)
- Color values (e.g., `#8B5CF6` for purple)
- Database column names (e.g., `presentations.outline`)
- JSONB structures (show the format)

**Most importantly:** Give me your honest assessment of what's realistic for MVP and what should wait for future versions.
