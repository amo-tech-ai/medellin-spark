## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

### Can you get the database password?
→ **YES**: Use **Method 1 (Automated Scripts)** - Fastest ✅
→ **NO**: Use **Method 2 (SQL Editor)** - No password needed ✅

Both methods work perfectly and achieve the same result!

---

## 🎯 Method 1: Automated Scripts (Recommended if you have DB password)

### Step 1: Get Database Password
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk/settings/database
2. Find section: **Database Password**
3. Click **"Show"** to reveal password
4. Copy it (you'll paste it in step 2)

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script
```bash
./scripts/deploy-migration.sh
```

**What it does**:
- Prompts for database password (paste the one from step 1)
- Tests connectivity (port 5432 direct connection)
- Applies migration
- Runs 6 verification queries
- Shows detailed results

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Database connection successful!
✓ Project linked successfully
✓ Migration applied successfully!
[Shows 6 verification query results]
Migration Deployment Complete!
```

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Function
```bash
./scripts/deploy-edge-function.sh
```

**What you need**: OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Secret set successfully
✓ Function deployed successfully!
[Shows test curl command]
Edge Function Deployment Complete!
```

### Step 4: Regenerate Types
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --remote > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
pnpm run build
```

**Done!** ✅ Your MVP is deployed

## 🎯 Method 2: SQL Editor (No password needed, works 100%)

### Step 1: Open SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk/sql/new

### Step 2: Copy Migration SQL
```bash
# Copy the entire migration file
cat supabase/migrations/20251013122458_fix_slides_relationship_and_rls.sql
```

### Step 3: Paste & Run
1. Paste the entire SQL into the editor
2. Click **"Run"** button (bottom right)
3. Wait for completion (10-15 seconds)
4. Should see: **"Success. No rows returned"** or **"ALTER TABLE"** confirmations

### Step 4: Verify Migration
Run these 6 queries one by one in SQL Editor:

#### Query 1: Check RLS is enabled
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity, forcerowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('pitch_decks', 'pitch_deck_slides');
```
**Expected**: Both tables show `t` (true) for `rowsecurity`

#### Query 2: Check deck_id column exists
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'pitch_deck_slides'
  AND column_name IN ('deck_id', 'slide_no')
ORDER BY column_name;
```
**Expected**: Shows `deck_id` (uuid, NO) and `slide_no` (integer, NO)

#### Query 3: Check composite primary key
```sql
SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type
FROM information_schema.table_constraints
WHERE table_name = 'pitch_deck_slides'
  AND constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY';
```
**Expected**: Shows PRIMARY KEY constraint

#### Query 4: Check foreign key
```sql
SELECT
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name = 'pitch_deck_slides';
```
**Expected**: Shows `deck_id` → `pitch_decks` relationship

#### Query 5: Check RLS policies
```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'pitch_deck_slides'
ORDER BY policyname;
```
**Expected**: Shows 5 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, public SELECT)

#### Query 6: Test helper function
```sql
SELECT get_pitch_deck_with_slides('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid) IS NULL as function_works;
```
**Expected**: Shows `t` (true) - function executes without error

### Step 5: Deploy Edge Function
```bash
./scripts/deploy-edge-function.sh
```
(Same as Method 1, Step 3)

### Step 6: Regenerate Types
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --remote > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
pnpm run build
```

**Done!** ✅ Your MVP is deployed

## 🔍 How to Verify Success

After deployment (either method), test the complete flow:

### 1. Test Edge Function
Use the curl command from the edge function deployment output, or:
```bash
# Get your anon key from .env
ANON_KEY=$(grep VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY .env | cut -d '=' -f2 | tr -d '"' | tr -d "'" | xargs)

# Test the function
curl -i --location --request POST \
  'https://dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-pitch-deck' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ANON_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "prompt": "Generate a pitch deck for a FinTech startup that helps people save money",
    "profile_id": "test-uuid"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deck_id": "some-uuid",
  "title": "AutoSave Pitch Deck",
  "company_name": "AutoSave",
  "slide_count": 10
}
```

### 2. Check Database
In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Should show the test deck
SELECT id, title, company_name FROM pitch_decks LIMIT 1;

-- Should show 10 slides
SELECT deck_id, slide_no FROM pitch_deck_slides ORDER BY slide_no;
```

### 3. Test Frontend
```bash
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# Sign in and test pitch deck creation
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

- ✅ Migration applied without errors
- ✅ All 6 verification queries pass
- ✅ RLS enabled on both tables
- ✅ `deck_id` and `slide_no` columns exist
- ✅ Composite primary key created
- ✅ Foreign key constraint exists
- ✅ All 5 RLS policies active
- ✅ Helper function works
- ✅ Edge function deployed
- ✅ Test curl returns `"success": true`
- ✅ TypeScript types regenerated
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Method 1 Issues

#### "Connection refused" on port 5432
**Fix**: Add your IP to allowlist
1. Go to: Dashboard → Database → Network Restrictions
2. Add your public IP address
3. Retry deployment script

#### "Password authentication failed"
**Fix**: Re-copy password from dashboard
1. Make sure there are no extra spaces
2. Password should be exactly as shown in dashboard
3. Try pasting directly instead of typing

#### psql not found
**Fix**: Install PostgreSQL client
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

### Method 2 Issues

#### "Permission denied" in SQL Editor
**Fix**: Make sure you're logged in as the project owner

#### "Relation already exists"
**Fix**: Some parts may already be applied - this is safe, continue with rest of migration

#### "Function already exists"
**Fix**: The migration uses `CREATE OR REPLACE`, so this is safe

## 🎯 After Deployment

1. ✅ Test pitch deck generation
2. ✅ Verify RLS (users can't see others' decks)
3. ✅ Check logs: `supabase functions logs generate-pitch-deck`
4. ✅ Monitor database performance in dashboard
5. 🔄 Plan Phase 2 features (rate limiting, caching)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Method 2 (SQL Editor)** if you're not comfortable with command line
2. **Save the curl command** from edge function deployment for testing
3. **Keep your database password secure** - don't commit it to git
4. **Monitor OpenAI costs** at platform.openai.com
5. **Check Supabase logs** regularly for any errors
