## Phase 1: Core Development Essentials (Start Here)

### Why These First?
You're actively building features. These plugins handle daily tasks: fixing bugs, writing clean code, understanding the codebase, and shipping features faster.

### Install Now

```bash
/plugin install claude-code-essentials
/plugin install full-stack-development
/plugin install testing-quality-suite
```

### Real-World Usage

#### 1. **claude-code-essentials** - Your Daily Driver

**What it does:** Code explanation, debugging, docs, PR reviews

**Use when:**
- "Explain how the PitchDeckWizard state management works"
- "Debug why dashboard events aren't loading"
- "Generate JSDoc comments for all utility functions"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "The contact form submission isn't working. Debug it."
‚Üí Uses debugger agent to trace the issue
‚Üí Finds missing form validation
‚Üí Shows exact line numbers with fixes
```

#### 2. **full-stack-development** - Feature Implementation

**What it does:** Coordinates backend API ‚Üí frontend UI ‚Üí testing ‚Üí deployment

**Use when:**
- "Build user authentication system"
- "Add payment processing for event tickets"
- "Create admin panel for managing startups"
- "Implement real-time notifications"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Add user profiles with avatar upload"
‚Üí backend-architect: Designs API endpoints
‚Üí frontend-developer: Creates React components
‚Üí test-automator: Writes unit + integration tests
‚Üí security-auditor: Checks for vulnerabilities
Result: Complete, tested feature in one workflow
```

#### 3. **testing-quality-suite** - Prevent Bugs

**What it does:** TDD workflows, automated test generation, quality gates

**Use when:**
- "Write tests for the event registration flow"
- "Set up integration tests for the dashboard"
- "Add E2E tests for pitch deck wizard"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Write comprehensive tests for Jobs page"
‚Üí Generates unit tests for components

```

---

## Phase 2: Quality & Security (Before Launch)

### Why These Next?
You're approaching launch. Need to ensure code quality, security, and performance before users arrive.

### Install Before Production

```bash
/plugin install code-quality-review
/plugin install security-scanning
/plugin install performance-optimization
```

### Real-World Usage

#### 4. **code-quality-review** - Polish Your Code

**What it does:** Multi-agent code review (architecture + security + performance)

**Use when:**
- "Review the entire dashboard module"
- "Check pitch deck wizard for best practices"
- "Audit codebase before launch"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Full review of authentication system"
‚Üí architect-review: Checks design patterns
‚Üí security-auditor: Finds auth vulnerabilities
‚Üí performance-engineer: Identifies bottlenecks
‚Üí test-automator: Checks test coverage
Result: Comprehensive quality report with fixes
```

#### 5. **security-scanning** - Lock It Down

**What it does:** SAST analysis, dependency scanning, OWASP compliance

**Use when:**
- "Scan for security vulnerabilities"
- "Check dependencies for CVEs"
- "Validate OWASP Top 10 compliance"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Security audit before production"
‚Üí Scans all dependencies (finds 3 vulnerable packages)
‚Üí Analyzes code for XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities
‚Üí Checks API endpoints for injection flaws
‚Üí Provides priority-ranked fixes
```

#### 6. **performance-optimization** - Make It Fast

**What it does:** Profiling, database optimization, caching, Core Web Vitals

**Use when:**
- "Dashboard is loading slowly"
- "Optimize event list performance"
- "Improve Lighthouse scores"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Events page is slow with 1000+ events"
‚Üí performance-engineer: Profiles the page
‚Üí Identifies: Large JSON payloads, no pagination
‚Üí Implements: Virtual scrolling + pagination
‚Üí Result: 3.2s ‚Üí 0.8s load time
```

---

## Phase 3: Scaling & Operations (Post-Launch)

### Why These Later?
Your app is live. Now focus on monitoring, incidents, and scaling infrastructure.

### Install When Scaling

```bash
/plugin install incident-diagnostics
/plugin install observability-monitoring
/plugin install deployment-orchestration
```

### Real-World Usage

#### 7. **incident-diagnostics** - Fix Production Issues Fast

**What it does:** Production triage, root cause analysis, distributed tracing

**Use when:**
- "Users can't register for events - fix now!"
- "Database queries timing out in production"
- "Trace why payment processing fails randomly"

**Example scenario:**
```
Production down! "500 errors on event registration"
‚Üí incident-responder: Analyzes logs immediately
‚Üí error-detective: Finds race condition in booking
‚Üí Identifies: Double-booking bug in concurrent requests
‚Üí Provides: Immediate fix + permanent solution
Result: Back online in 15 minutes
```

#### 8. **observability-monitoring** - See Everything

**What it does:** Metrics, logging, tracing, SLO implementation

**Use when:**
- "Set up production monitoring"
- "Create Grafana dashboards"
- "Track API response times"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Monitor critical user flows"
‚Üí Sets up metrics for: registrations, payments, events
‚Üí Creates dashboards showing: uptime, latency, errors
‚Üí Configures alerts for: API errors > 5%, p95 > 2s
Result: Proactive monitoring before users complain
```

#### 9. **deployment-orchestration** - Ship Safely

**What it does:** Pre-flight checks, rollout strategies, automated rollback

**Use when:**
- "Deploy v2.0 with zero downtime"
- "Set up canary deployments"
- "Automate rollback if errors spike"

**Example scenario:**
```
You: "Deploy payment system update safely"
‚Üí Pre-flight: Runs tests, checks dependencies
‚Üí Strategy: Canary to 5% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 100% users
‚Üí Monitoring: Watches error rates during rollout
‚Üí Auto-rollback: Triggers if errors > threshold
Result: Safe deployment with instant rollback option
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small**: Install 1-2 plugins, learn them well
2. **Be specific**: "Add user auth" vs "Create authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing, session management"
3. **Iterate**: Let agents complete work, review, then refine
4. **Check results**: Always verify agent work before committing
5. **Build habits**: Use plugins for daily tasks to build muscle memory
