## How to Use These Agents

### Method 1: Natural Language (Recommended)

Simply describe what you need and Claude will automatically invoke the appropriate agent(s):

```bash
"Debug why the contact form isn't submitting"
→ Invokes: debugger agent

"Build user authentication system"
→ Invokes: backend-architect, frontend-developer, security-auditor, test-automator

"Optimize the Events page performance"
→ Invokes: performance-engineer, database-optimizer
```

### Method 2: Explicit Agent Request

Request a specific agent by name:

```bash
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Use mermaid-expert to create a sequence diagram of the login flow"
"Use docs-architect to document the entire Events feature"
```

### Method 3: Multi-Agent Workflows

Request multiple agents for comprehensive solutions:

```bash
"Use full-stack-development workflow to:
- Design the API (backend-architect)
- Build the UI (frontend-developer)
- Write tests (test-automator)
- Review security (security-auditor)
- Deploy safely (deployment-engineer)"
```
