## 🔗 Integration Strategy (NEW)

**Documents:** [Integration Strategy](../007-integration-strategy-presentation-ai.md) | [Quick Summary](../INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md)

**Purpose:** Define how Presentation-AI integrates as the pitch-deck and event-presentation layer of Medellin AI.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Architecture:** API-first via Supabase Edge Functions (no direct DB coupling)
- **Authentication:** Shared JWT (Supabase Auth) for seamless user experience
- **Data Flow:** Medellin AI → Edge Function → Presentation-AI API → Webhook → Storage
- **User Journey:** Click "Generate Deck" → AI generates slides → Download PDF/PPTX (<1 min)
- **Security:** RLS policies, JWT validation, webhook signatures, sanitized inputs
- **Roadmap:** Phase 1 (Core Integration: Week 1-2) → Phase 2 (Customization: Week 3-4) → Phase 3 (Optimization: Week 5+)

## 🏗️ System Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3 + TypeScript 5.x + Vite 5.x
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS 3.x + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 15 + Auth + Storage + RLS)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase Cloud (backend)
- **Tools**: pnpm, Claude Code, Task Master AI

### Architecture Pattern
**Serverless JAMstack**: Direct database access from browser via Supabase JS SDK, eliminating the need for a custom API layer. Security enforced via Row Level Security (RLS) policies at the database level.

### Core Features (MVP)
1. **Events**: Browse, register, check-in (9 tables: events, tickets, registrations, waitlist, sponsors, venues, event_venues, organizers)
2. **Jobs Marketplace**: Post jobs, apply, AI-powered matching (6 tables: jobs, applications, candidates, companies, job_skills, candidate_skills, matches)
3. **Startup Perks**: Claim perks from providers (4 tables: perks, perk_claims, saved_perks, startup_profiles)
4. **Pitch Deck Wizard**: Generate AI-powered pitch decks (1 table: wizard_sessions with JSONB state)

## 📈 Key Metrics

### Database Schema
- **19 core tables** + auth tables (Supabase managed)
- **70+ indexes** (60+ FK indexes, 10+ composite/partial indexes)
- **100+ RLS policies** (select, insert, update, delete across all tables)
- **11 migrations** (extensions, schema, indexes, triggers, RLS, security fixes, marketplace tables)

### Frontend Components
- **15 pages**: Home, Events, Jobs, Perks, Pitch Deck Wizard, Dashboard, About, Contact, Programs, Blog, etc.
- **3 custom hooks**: useAuth, useSupabase, useToast
- **shadcn/ui components**: Button, Card, Form, Input, Select, Toast, and more

### Performance Characteristics
- **Browse events**: ~150ms (SELECT with JOIN, Supabase cached)
- **Event details**: ~100ms (single query, 3 table joins)
- **OAuth login**: ~2-3s (Google OAuth redirect + profile creation)
- **Registration insert**: ~200ms (1 INSERT + 2 trigger UPDATEs)
- **Payment update**: ~150ms (1 UPDATE + 2 trigger UPDATEs)

## 🔐 Security Model

### Authentication
- **OAuth**: Google, GitHub (via Supabase Auth)
- **Email/Password**: bcrypt hashing (Supabase managed)
- **JWT**: Signed tokens with 1-hour expiry, auto-refresh

### Authorization (RLS Policies)
- **Public Read**: Published events, jobs, perks visible to all (authenticated + anon)
- **Authenticated Write**: Users can only insert records they own
- **Owner Manage**: Users can update/delete only their records
- **Admin Override**: `has_role('admin')` bypasses ownership checks

### Row Level Security Examples
```sql
-- Public can view published events
CREATE POLICY "events_select_published"
  ON events FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated, anon
  USING (status = 'published' AND deleted_at IS NULL);

-- Users can only register themselves
CREATE POLICY "registrations_insert_authenticated"
  ON registrations FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (profile_id = current_profile_id());

-- Organizers can update their own events
CREATE POLICY "events_update_own_organizer"
  ON events FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM organizers
      WHERE organizers.id = events.organizer_id
        AND organizers.profile_id = current_profile_id()
    )
  );
```

## 🎯 Key Insights from Diagrams

### 1. From Flowchart (System Overview)
- **No custom API layer**: Direct database access via Supabase JS SDK reduces latency and complexity
- **RLS at database level**: Security enforced before data leaves database (no bypass possible)
- **Trigger-based consistency**: Auto-counters (`registered_count`, `sold_count`) maintained by database triggers

### 2. From Sequence Diagram (Event Registration)
- **6-phase flow**: Browse → Details → Auth → Register → Payment → Check-in
- **OAuth adds 2-3s**: Google OAuth redirect is the slowest part of registration
- **Triggers add 50-100ms**: Trade-off for guaranteed consistency (no counter drift)

### 3. From State Diagram (Event Lifecycle)
- **4 primary states**: Draft → Published → Cancelled/Completed (enum enforced at DB)
- **Soft deletes**: 30-day recovery window via `deleted_at` timestamp
- **Auto-transitions**: Events should auto-transition to Completed after event_date (currently manual)

### 4. From ERD (Database Schema)
- **Polymorphic-lite pattern**: Core tables (profiles, venues, organizers, companies) referenced by domain tables
- **Junction tables**: event_venues, job_skills, candidate_skills, saved_perks (many-to-many)
- **JSONB flexibility**: wizard_sessions.session_data, perk_claims.claim_details (schema-less)

### 5. From User Journey (Startup Founder)
- **4.5/5 satisfaction**: Overall positive experience with friction points identified
- **Peak moments**: AI fit scoring, $10k perk savings, pitch deck generation
- **Pain points**: 2-3 day verification wait, simulated payment, no email notifications

### 6. From Class Diagram (Component Architecture)
- **3-layer architecture**: Frontend (React), Backend (Supabase SDK), Database (PostgreSQL)
- **30+ classes/components**: 15 pages/components, 8 hooks/services, 7+ database tables
- **Design patterns**: Repository, Facade, Observer, Policy, Custom Hooks

## 🚀 Top 5 Recommendations

Based on analysis across all 6 diagrams, here are the **top 5 improvements** to prioritize:

### 1. **Add Email Notifications** (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Current**: No automated emails for event reminders, application updates, or perk approvals
**Impact**: Reduce no-show rate by 30%, increase engagement by 50%
**Implementation**: Supabase Edge Function + SendGrid API, triggered by database events

### 2. **Integrate Real Payments** (High Impact, Medium Effort)
**Current**: Simulated payment flow undermines trust and limits revenue
**Impact**: Enable paid events ($20-$100 tickets), generate 10% platform fee revenue
**Implementation**: Stripe Checkout + webhook handling for payment confirmation

### 3. **Automate Perk Verification** (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
**Current**: Manual 2-3 day verification is #1 friction point for perks
**Impact**: Increase perk claim rate by 40%, reduce admin workload by 80%
**Implementation**: Automated checks via LinkedIn company page or domain ownership verification

### 4. **Add Full-Text Search** (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
**Current**: No search functionality; users must scroll through all events/jobs
**Impact**: Improve findability by 10x, especially as content scales (50+ events, 200+ jobs)
**Implementation**: PostgreSQL GIN indexes on `to_tsvector('english', description)`

### 5. **Implement Scheduled State Transitions** (Low Impact, Low Effort)
**Current**: Events remain in Published state after event date passes (no auto-transition)
**Impact**: Cleaner data model, accurate analytics, automatic archival
**Implementation**: PostgreSQL pg_cron or Supabase Edge Function scheduled daily

## 📝 System Summary

**Medellin-Spark** is a serverless JAMstack platform connecting Medellín's startup ecosystem through 4 core features: **Events** (networking), **Jobs** (hiring), **Perks** (cost savings), and **Pitch Deck Wizard** (fundraising). The platform uses **React 18 + TypeScript + Vite** for the frontend and **Supabase** (PostgreSQL 15 + Auth + Storage + RLS) for the backend, eliminating the need for a custom API layer. All database operations are performed directly from the browser via the Supabase JS SDK, with security enforced by **100+ Row Level Security (RLS) policies** at the database level.

The database schema consists of **19 tables** across 4 domains, with **70+ indexes** optimizing query performance and **11 migrations** documenting schema evolution from initial setup through security fixes and marketplace tables. The frontend includes **15 pages** and **3 custom hooks** (useAuth, useSupabase, useToast) abstracting Supabase SDK operations. Key design patterns include **Repository** (via QueryBuilder), **Facade** (Supabase Client), **Observer** (Realtime subscriptions), and **Policy** (RLS).

**User satisfaction**: 4.5/5 overall, with peak moments in AI fit scoring, perk savings, and pitch deck generation. Pain points include 2-3 day verification wait, simulated payment, and no email notifications. **Top recommendations**: Add email notifications, integrate real payments, automate perk verification, add full-text search, and implement scheduled state transitions.
