## Explanation

This user journey maps the **complete startup founder experience** on Medellin-Spark from initial discovery to becoming a power user. The journey spans 9 sections over 6 months, demonstrating how the platform's four core features (Events, Jobs, Perks, Pitch Deck Wizard) create a comprehensive ecosystem for startup founders.

**Discovery & Signup (Satisfaction: 3-5/5)**: The founder discovers Medellin-Spark through word-of-mouth or search. The landing page showcases upcoming events and job listings without requiring login (public read via RLS). Clicking "Sign in with Google" initiates OAuth flow, and the system automatically creates a `profiles` record via the `on_auth_user_created` trigger. The friction point is the OAuth consent screen (satisfaction drops to 4/5), but the auto-profile creation improves UX (no manual profile form).

**First Event Registration (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: The founder browses events, filtered by `status = 'published'` and `deleted_at IS NULL` via RLS. Event details show available capacity (50 spots via `events.capacity - events.registered_count`). Selecting a ticket and registering triggers the `trg_update_event_registered_count` trigger, ensuring accurate counter updates. The simulated payment flow is a friction point (satisfaction 4/5), but confirmation is instant.

**Event Attendance (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: The founder receives an email reminder (future feature, not implemented). On event day, the organizer checks the founder in via QR code scan (or manual lookup), setting `registration.attended = true`, `check_in_time = now()`, and `status = 'attended'`. The founder networks, meeting potential co-foundersâ€”this is a **peak moment** (satisfaction 5/5).

**Job Search & Hiring (Satisfaction: 3-5/5)**: The founder transitions from attendee to hiring manager. Creating a company profile and posting a job requires multiple form fields (satisfaction drops to 4/5). Once published, the job appears in public listings. The platform's **AI-powered fit scoring** (0-100 scale) ranks applicants, allowing the founder to filter top candidates (score > 85%). This is an **aha moment** (satisfaction 5/5) as it saves hours of manual resume screening.

**Reviewing Applications (Satisfaction: 5/5)**: The founder reviews 12 applications, sorted by `applications.fit_score DESC`. The AI-generated scores (65-92%) provide instant insights into candidate-job fit based on skill matching (`job_skills` â†” `candidate_skills` junction tables). The founder schedules interviews with the top 2 candidates and updates their `application.stage` to `interview`. This demonstrates the **Jobs Marketplace** value proposition: connecting startups with qualified candidates faster than traditional job boards.

**Perks Discovery & Verification (Satisfaction: 3-5/5)**: The founder discovers the Perks program, browsing 20+ active perks (filtered by `perks.active = true` via RLS). However, claiming perks requires **startup verification** (`startup_profiles.verified = true`), creating a friction point (satisfaction drops to 3/5). The founder submits a startup profile and waits 2-3 days for admin approval. This manual verification step ensures perk providers receive legitimate claims but adds delay.

**Claiming Perks (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: Once verified, the founder claims the "$10k AWS credits" perk. The claim enters the `perk_claims` table with `status = 'pending'`. After admin approval (`status = 'approved'`, `approved_at = now()`), the founder receives redemption instructions and redeems the credits (`status = 'redeemed'`, `redeemed_at = now()`). This represents **$10k in cost savings**, a significant value metric (satisfaction 5/5).

**Pitch Deck Wizard (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: The founder needs a pitch deck for investor meetings. The Pitch Deck Wizard stores session state in `wizard_sessions.session_data` (JSONB), allowing the founder to answer questions incrementally and resume later. Upon completion, the AI generates a 12-slide deck in 15 seconds, storing the PDF URL in `wizard_sessions.deck_url`. The founder downloads the deck, reviews it, edits 3 slides manually, and re-downloads. This **self-serve pitch deck creation** eliminates the $2k-$5k cost of hiring a designer (satisfaction 5/5).

**Pitch to Investors (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: The founder emails the deck to 8 investors, receives 3 meeting requests, presents the deck, and secures a $500k seed round. This is the **ultimate outcome** enabled by Medellin-Spark's Pitch Deck Wizard. The platform's ROI is clear: $500k raised >> $0 platform cost (freemium model).

**Return Visit & Power User (Satisfaction: 5/5)**: Over 6 months, the founder becomes a power user, attending 5 events, hiring 3 employees, claiming 6 perks ($50k saved), and creating 2 pitch decks. The founder transitions from user to advocate, sponsoring an event ($2k) and referring friends. This demonstrates **platform stickiness** and **word-of-mouth growth**.
