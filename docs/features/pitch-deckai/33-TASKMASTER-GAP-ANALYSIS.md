# üîç TASKMASTER GAP ANALYSIS - CRITICAL MISSING TASKS

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify critical gaps between current `tasks.json` and master plans/checklists  
**Status:** üî¥ **5 CRITICAL TASKS MISSING** - Must be added before implementation begins

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Analysis
- **Tasks in `tasks.json`:** 10 tasks ‚úÖ
- **Critical gaps identified:** 5 missing foundation tasks üî¥
- **Risk level:** HIGH - Missing core infrastructure tasks
- **Impact:** Could cause implementation failures and delays

### Gap Categories
1. **Foundation Tasks (3 missing)** - Basic infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Routing Tasks (1 missing)** - Core navigation and protection
3. **Validation Tasks (1 missing)** - Quality gates before production

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Build MyPresentations Grid & Page (MVP)** - MISSING
**Why Critical:** This is the entry point for all presentation flows. Master plan explicitly requires this as a foundation task.

**Evidence from Master Plans:**
- `26-checklist.md` Line 156: "üü¢ MyPresentationsGrid.tsx - Grid layout with responsive cards"
- `28-pages-plan.md` Line 45: "Create MyPresentationsPage.tsx ‚Ä¶ compose PageHeader + CreateNewSection + Grid"
- `22-UI-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 89: "Adapt to MyPresentationsGrid.tsx"

**Current Problem:** 
- Task 5 (Advanced Dashboard) assumes basic dashboard exists
- No task creates the foundational `MyPresentationsGrid.tsx` and `MyPresentationsPage.tsx`
- Users can't access presentations without this basic interface

**Required Components:**
- `MyPresentationsGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid layout (3‚Üí2‚Üí1 columns)
- `MyPresentationsPage.tsx` - Page composition with PageHeader + CreateNewSection + Grid
- Empty state handling for new users
- Basic loading states and error handling
- Simple sort/filter functionality

**Implementation Order:** Must come BEFORE Task 5 (Advanced Dashboard Features)

---

### 2. **Configure /presentations Routing with ProtectedRoute** - MISSING
**Why Critical:** Core navigation infrastructure. Master plan has separate documentation for this phase.

**Evidence from Master Plans:**
- `sitemap.md` Line 67: "üöß In Progress - /presentations (My Presentations Dashboard)"
- `30-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 234: "Add /presentations route ‚Ä¶ Configure ProtectedRoute ‚Ä¶ Test navigation"
- `26-checklist.md` Line 89: "üü¢ /presentations route configured with ProtectedRoute"

**Current Problem:**
- Task 5 assumes routing exists but no task creates it
- Users can't navigate to presentations without proper routing
- ProtectedRoute configuration not explicitly covered

**Required Implementation:**
- Add `/presentations` route to App.tsx
- Configure ProtectedRoute wrapper
- Import and test navigation
- Verify route protection works correctly

**Implementation Order:** Must come BEFORE Task 5 (Advanced Dashboard Features)

---

### 3. **Apply Supabase Migrations & Verify RLS/RPC** - MISSING
**Why Critical:** Database foundation. Master plan calls for applying migrations before feature work.

**Evidence from Master Plans:**
- `30-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 51: "Add 8 metadata columns from failed migration"
- `26-checklist.md` Line 98: "üü¢ Migration files applied and verified"
- `00-master-plan.md` Line 234: "Apply migration via Dashboard ‚Ä¶ Verify tables ‚Ä¶ Validate RPC"

**Current Problem:**
- Task 2 (Data Layer) assumes database is ready
- No task explicitly applies and verifies migrations
- RLS policies and RPC functions not validated
- Could cause data layer failures

**Required Implementation:**
- Apply `20251013150000_add_presentations_metadata.sql` migration
- Verify all 8 metadata columns exist in presentations table
- Test RLS policies with cross-user data isolation
- Validate RPC functions (soft_delete_presentation, duplicate_presentation)
- Smoke test CRUD operations from client

**Implementation Order:** Must come BEFORE Task 2 (Data Layer)

---

### 4. **E2E CRUD + Responsive Validation (Pre-Hardening Gate)** - MISSING
**Why Critical:** Quality gate before production. Master plan has dedicated testing phase.

**Evidence from Master Plans:**
- `26-checklist.md` Line 445: "üü¢ E2E testing suite created"
- `30-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 289: "Run TypeScript build ‚Ä¶ Test all CRUD ‚Ä¶ Test responsive design"
- `22-UI-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 156: "Test responsive design (375px, 768px, 1440px)"

**Current Problem:**
- Task 10 (Production Hardening) bundles testing with optimization
- No dedicated testing gate before production features
- Could miss critical bugs before advanced features

**Required Implementation:**
- Create, view, edit, duplicate, soft delete presentations
- Test responsive design: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)
- Verify no console errors across all operations
- Test cross-user data isolation
- Validate all CRUD operations work correctly

**Implementation Order:** Should come AFTER Task 3 (Plate.js Editor) but BEFORE Task 10 (Production Hardening)

---

### 5. **Accessibility Audit (WCAG AA)** - MISSING
**Why Critical:** Success criteria requirement. Master plan lists this as required.

**Evidence from Master Plans:**
- `26-checklist.md` Line 512: "üü¢ Accessibility (WCAG AA) compliance verified"
- `28-pages-plan.md` Line 234: "Accessibility (WCAG AA)" listed as success criterion
- `22-UI-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Line 189: "Keyboard navigation, focus states, color contrast"

**Current Problem:**
- No task explicitly covers accessibility audit
- Could miss WCAG AA compliance requirements
- Risk of accessibility issues in production

**Required Implementation:**
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Focus states verification
- Color contrast analysis (4.5:1 ratio minimum)
- Alt text for all images
- Screen reader compatibility
- Create remediation list for any issues found

**Implementation Order:** Should come AFTER Task 9 (Viewer) but BEFORE Task 10 (Production Hardening)

### Risk Mitigation
**Before Adding Tasks:**
- üî¥ High risk of implementation failures
- üî¥ Missing foundational infrastructure
- üî¥ No quality gates before production

**After Adding Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Proper foundation before advanced features
- ‚úÖ Quality gates at appropriate stages
- ‚úÖ Reduced risk of implementation failures

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Add the 5 missing tasks** to `tasks.json` using the provided JSON structures
2. **Update task dependencies** to reflect the new order
3. **Verify task numbering** doesn't conflict with existing tasks
4. **Test task dependencies** make logical sense

### Implementation Order
1. **Week 1:** Tasks 1, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 (Foundation)
2. **Week 2:** Task 2 (Data Layer)
3. **Week 3:** Task 3 (Plate.js Editor)
4. **Week 4:** Tasks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Features)
5. **Week 5:** Task 9 (Viewer)
6. **Week 6:** Tasks 8.5, 9.5, 10 (Testing & Production)

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All 5 missing tasks added to `tasks.json`
- ‚úÖ Dependencies updated correctly
- ‚úÖ Implementation order makes logical sense
- ‚úÖ Quality gates positioned appropriately
- ‚úÖ Foundation tasks come before advanced features

---

## üìä SUMMARY

**Current State:** 10 tasks in `tasks.json`  
**Missing Critical Tasks:** 5 foundation tasks  
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Missing core infrastructure  
**Recommended Action:** Add all 5 missing tasks immediately  

**Impact of Adding Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Proper foundation before advanced features
- ‚úÖ Quality gates at appropriate stages  
- ‚úÖ Reduced implementation risk
- ‚úÖ Aligned with master plans and checklists
- ‚úÖ Logical implementation order

**Bottom Line:** The current `tasks.json` is missing 5 critical foundation tasks that are explicitly required by the master plans. Adding these tasks will align the implementation with the documented requirements and significantly reduce the risk of implementation failures.
