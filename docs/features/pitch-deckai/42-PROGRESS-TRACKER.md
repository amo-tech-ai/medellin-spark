## 🔍 CRITICAL DISCOVERY

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reference Project Analysis

**Key Finding:** `reference-presentation-ai` is **ALREADY USING VITE**, not Next.js!

#### Evidence:
```json
// reference-presentation-ai/package.json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build",
  "dev": "vite",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

#### What This Means:
✅ **Good News:**
- No Next.js → Vite conversion needed
- Plate.js already installed (30 packages)
- Vite config already exists
- Build system compatible

🔴 **Work Required:**
- Convert Prisma → Supabase
- Replace auth system (currently uses @auth/prisma-adapter)
- Adapt database queries
- No API routes to convert (already client-side)

### Revised Conversion Scope

| Original Estimate | Actual Scope | Time Savings |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Convert Next.js to Vite | ❌ Not needed | -2 weeks |
| Install Plate.js | ✅ Already done | -1 week |
| Setup build system | ✅ Already done | -2 days |
| **Total Time Saved** | | **~3 weeks** |

**New Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (was 2-3 weeks)

   ```

3. **Copy Plate.js Components** (1 hour)
   ```bash
   cp -r reference-presentation-ai/src/components/plate src/components/
   # Adapt for Supabase Storage
   ```

### Priority 2: Core Functionality (Do Next)

4. **Enhance Presentations Store** (1 hour)
   - Add editor state
   - Add generation status
   - Add auto-save
