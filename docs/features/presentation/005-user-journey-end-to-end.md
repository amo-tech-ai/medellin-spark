## Explanation

This user journey maps the complete end-to-end experience from discovering Presentation-AI to becoming a power user. The journey is divided into nine sections, each representing a key phase of user interaction.

**Discovery & Signup (Satisfaction: 3-5/5)**: Users land on the website, watch a demo video to understand capabilities, and sign in with Google OAuth. The experience is smooth but requires granting permissions, which slightly reduces satisfaction during OAuth flow.

**First Presentation (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: New users see an empty dashboard with a prominent "New Presentation" button. They enter a topic (e.g., "AI Startup Pitch"), configure settings (slide count, language, style, web search), and click "Generate." The Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut delights power users.

**AI Generation (Satisfaction: 3-5/5)**: This is the most critical phase. Users watch the outline stream in real-time, seeing the title appear first, then topics populate one by one. The progressive slide rendering (slides appear as they're generated) and asynchronous image loading (placeholders first, images load in background) maintain engagement during the 15-25 second generation process.

**Editing & Customization (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: The Plate Editor enables inline text editing, drag-and-drop slide reordering, and real-time auto-save. Users appreciate the "Saving..." indicator (transparency) and instant theme changes (9 built-in themes). The auto-save debouncing (2 seconds) prevents spam while ensuring work is never lost.

**Presenting (Satisfaction: 5/5)**: Fullscreen presentation mode with keyboard navigation (arrows, spacebar) provides a polished presenting experience. ESC returns to edit mode seamlessly.

**Sharing & Export (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: Public sharing generates a unique URL that anyone can view without login. PDF export takes 3-4 seconds and produces high-quality files. PPTX export is available but has limited layout support.

**Return Visit (Satisfaction: 4-5/5)**: Returning users see their dashboard with presentation thumbnails. Clicking a presentation loads it instantly (database read + Zustand hydration). The "Duplicate" feature enables quick iteration.

**Power User Features (Satisfaction: 5/5)**: After creating multiple presentations, users unlock advanced features like custom themes with company logos, favorites, folders, and archiving. These features demonstrate mastery and increase retention.

## Recommendations for Medellin AI Integration

Based on this user journey analysis, here are key recommendations for integrating Presentation-AI concepts into Medellin AI:

### 1. Streaming Must Be Priority #1
**Why**: The difference between a 20-second blank screen and progressive rendering is massive. Users stay engaged when they see real-time progress.

**Implementation**:
- Use Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` for outline and slide generation
- Update UI incrementally as chunks arrive
- Show "Generating outline... 40%" progress indicators

### 2. Auto-save Is Non-negotiable
**Why**: Users expect their work to be saved automatically. Manual save is a relic of desktop software.

**Implementation**:
- Debounce saves (2 seconds for text edits, immediate for structural changes)
- Show "Saving..." â†’ "Saved" indicator
- Warn before closing tab with unsaved changes

### 3. Async Images Prevent Bottlenecks
**Why**: Image generation takes 3-5 seconds per image. Blocking slide rendering for images kills UX.

**Implementation**:
- Render slides with image placeholders immediately
- Generate images in parallel (use `Promise.all()`)
- Update slides as images load

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts for Power Users
**Why**: Users who create 5+ presentations become power users. They demand efficiency.

**Implementation**:
- Ctrl+Enter to generate
- Ctrl+S to manual save (even with auto-save)
- Arrows for slide navigation
- Ctrl+Z for undo

### 5. Public Sharing = Viral Growth
**Why**: "Check out this presentation I made with AI" drives signups. Frictionless sharing is critical.

**Implementation**:
- Public URLs with no login required
- Embed option for websites/blogs
- "Made with Medellin AI" watermark (clickable)

### 6. Export Quality = Credibility
**Why**: If the PDF looks amateur, users won't trust the platform. Export is the final impression.

**Implementation**:
- High-res PDF (300 DPI minimum)
- Preserve all layouts and styles
- Optimize file size (compress images)
