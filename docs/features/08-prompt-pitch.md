## LOVABLE PROMPT FOR PHASE 1

```
Hey Lovable! I need to enhance the existing /pitch-deck AI wizard page. 

Current state: Basic wizard exists but needs major upgrades.

New design: 3-step wizard with better UX and smart defaults.

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING POINT
-----------------------------------

Create a centered layout with 3 large clickable cards:

Card 1: üìù Prompt
- Icon: Pencil/document icon
- Title: "Describe with words"
- Description: "Tell AI what you need"
- On click: Go to Step 2

Card 2: üìÑ Upload
- Icon: Upload icon
- Title: "Upload Document"
- Description: "PDF, DOCX, or TXT (max 10MB)"
- On click: Show file upload modal
- File upload modal:
  * Drag & drop zone
  * File type filter: .pdf, .docx, .txt
  * Max size: 10MB
  * Show "Analyzing document..." spinner after upload
  * Extract text and go to Step 2 with pre-filled data

Card 3: üìã Template
- Icon: Grid/template icon
- Title: "Start with Template"
- Description: "Use proven structure"
- On click: Go to template library (we'll build this in Phase 2)

Below the cards, add "Popular Topics" section:
- 8 pill-shaped buttons in 2 rows
- Buttons: [Investor Pitch] [Sales Proposal] [Product Launch] [Quarterly Review]
         [Team Training] [Company Update] [Grant Proposal] [Marketing Plan]
- On click: Pre-fill AI prompt and skip to Step 3

STEP 2: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
-----------------------------

Show a clean form with 5 questions:

1. Who is your audience?
   - Radio buttons: Investors/VCs, Clients/Customers, Internal Team, Partners, General Public

2. What's your goal?
   - Radio buttons: Raise Funding, Win Deal, Train Team, Get Partnership, Report Progress

3. Presentation length?
   - Radio buttons: Quick (5-7 slides), Standard (10-15 slides), Detailed (18-25 slides), Let AI decide

4. Tone preference?
   - Radio buttons: Professional, Conversational, Technical

5. Industry/Category?
   - Dropdown: Tech Startup, Healthcare, Education, Finance, E-commerce, SaaS, AI/ML, Other

At bottom:
- [Skip] button (uses defaults)
- [Continue ‚Üí] button (purple, primary)

STEP 3: AI PROCESSING
---------------------

Show loading screen with progress indicators:

Title: "ü§ñ AI is creating your presentation..."

Progress list (animated checkmarks):
- ‚úÖ Parsed your input
- ‚úÖ Analyzed audience and goals
- üîÑ Generating slide structure... (8/15 slides)
- ‚è≥ Adding data visualizations...
- ‚è≥ Selecting optimal layouts...

Show estimated time: "Estimated: 30 seconds remaining"

When complete: Redirect to /presentations/:id/outline

DESIGN NOTES:

That's it for Phase 1! Focus on the 3-step wizard flow with good UX.
