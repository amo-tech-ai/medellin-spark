# Events Feature Production Readiness Plan

**Status**: In Progress  
**Target**: 100% Production Ready  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Complete end-to-end setup, testing, and validation of Events feature with Supabase integration, RLS security, analytics tracking, and production-grade error handling.

---

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅
**Goal**: Install dependencies and verify basic connectivity

- [x] Add `date-fns` package for date formatting
- [x] Verify Supabase client configuration
- [x] Confirm types are properly defined
- [x] Check hooks implementation
- [x] Create analytics tracking utilities

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ `date-fns` installed and importable
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Hooks return correct data structure
- ✅ Analytics utility created and integrated

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

### Phase 2: RLS Policy Validation 🔄
**Goal**: Verify Row-Level Security is properly configured

#### Current RLS Policies to Verify:

**Events Table**:
```sql
-- Anonymous users can view published events
SELECT: (status = 'published' AND deleted_at IS NULL)

-- Event organizers can manage their events
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: (organizer owns event via organizers.profile_id)
```

**Registrations Table**:
```sql
-- Users can view their own registrations
SELECT: (profile_id = current_profile_id())

-- Users can register for published events
INSERT: (profile_id = current_profile_id() AND event is published)

-- Users can cancel their registrations
UPDATE/DELETE: (profile_id = current_profile_id())
```

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Anonymous user can list published events
- [ ] Anonymous user CANNOT see draft events
- [ ] Authenticated user can register for event
- [ ] User CANNOT register twice (unique constraint)
- [ ] User can view their own registrations
- [ ] User CANNOT view other users' registrations
- [ ] User can cancel their own registration

**Tools**: 
- Supabase Analytics Query
- Manual testing with test accounts

---

### Phase 3: Analytics Tracking ✅
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive event tracking for funnels

#### Events to Track:

**Page Views**:
```typescript
// Track when pages load
analytics.page('Events List Viewed');
analytics.page('Event Detail Viewed', { eventId, eventTitle });
```

**User Actions**:
```typescript
// Registration flow
analytics.track('Registration Started', { eventId, eventTitle });
analytics.track('Registration Completed', { eventId, eventTitle, timestamp });
analytics.track('Registration Failed', { eventId, error, reason });
analytics.track('Registration Cancelled', { eventId, eventTitle });

// Discovery
analytics.track('Event Card Clicked', { eventId, position, listType });
analytics.track('Event Shared', { eventId, method });
analytics.track('Event Filtered', { filterType, value });
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// src/lib/analytics.ts - COMPLETE
export const analytics = {
  page: (name: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => {
    // Send to analytics provider (Plausible, PostHog, etc.)
    console.log('[Analytics] Page:', name, properties);
  },
  
  track: (event: string, properties?: Record<string, any>) => {
    console.log('[Analytics] Event:', event, properties);
  }
};
```

**Integrated in**:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useEvents.ts` - List load tracking
- ✅ `src/hooks/useEventDetail.ts` - Detail view tracking
- ✅ `src/hooks/useEventRegistration.ts` - Registration flow tracking
- ✅ `src/pages/Events.tsx` - Page view tracking
- ✅ `src/pages/EventDetail.tsx` - Page view tracking
- ✅ `src/components/events/EventCard.tsx` - Click tracking

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All critical events tracked
- ✅ Properties include relevant context
- ✅ No PII in analytics data
- ✅ Console logs confirm events fire

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing 🔄
**Goal**: Verify complete user journeys work flawlessly

#### Test Scenarios:

**1. Anonymous Browse → Register Flow**
```
Steps:
1. Visit /events (not logged in)
2. See published events grid
3. Click event card
4. See event details
5. Click "Register" → redirected to /auth?redirect=/events/:id
6. Sign up / log in
7. Redirected back to event detail
8. Registration button becomes "✓ Registered" badge
9. Toast shows success message

Expected:
✅ All states render correctly
✅ Auth redirect preserves destination
✅ Registration succeeds after auth
✅ UI updates immediately (optimistic)
✅ Analytics fires for each step
```

**2. Registered User Flow**
```
Steps:
1. Visit /events (logged in, already registered for Event A)
2. Click Event A
3. See "✓ Registered" badge (not button)
4. Click Event B
5. Click "Register"
6. See success toast
7. Badge replaces button

Expected:
✅ Correct registration status per event
✅ No duplicate registration errors
✅ Smooth UI transitions
✅ Toast notifications work
```

**3. Error Cases**
```
Scenarios:
- Event at capacity → "Event Full" badge
- Event in past → "Event Ended" badge
- Network timeout → Error state with retry
- Duplicate registration → Friendly toast
- RLS block → Error with explanation

Expected:
✅ No crashes
✅ Clear error messages
✅ Retry mechanisms work
✅ User can recover gracefully
```

**4. Mobile Experience (390px)**
```
Steps:
1. Open /events on mobile viewport
2. Scroll through cards
3. Tap event card
4. See full detail page
5. Tap register button (44px+ tap target)
6. See success state

Expected:
✅ Cards responsive and readable
✅ Images load quickly (lazy)
✅ Buttons easy to tap
✅ No horizontal scroll
✅ Toast visible and readable
```

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization 🔄
**Goal**: Ensure fast load times and smooth interactions

**Metrics**:
- [ ] LCP < 2.5s on 3G Fast
- [ ] CLS < 0.1
- [ ] TTI < 5s
- [ ] Image load < 1s

**Optimizations**:
```typescript
// Lazy load images
<img src={event.image_url} loading="lazy" />

// Optimize queries (select only needed columns)
.select('id, title, date, location, cover_url, capacity, registered_count')

// Add indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_events_status_date ON events(status, date) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_registrations_lookup ON registrations(event_id, profile_id);
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] No layout shift
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP)
- [ ] Queries under 200ms
