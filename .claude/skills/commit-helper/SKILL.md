## Process

1. **Analyze Changes**
   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   ```

2. **Identify Type**
   - New feature? â†’ `feat`
   - Fixing bug? â†’ `fix`
   - Security? â†’ `security`
   - Cleanup? â†’ `refactor`

3. **Write Subject**
   - Start with verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
   - Keep under 50 characters
   - No period at end

4. **Add Body**
   - Bullet points for key changes
   - Explain WHY not just WHAT
   - Reference issues if applicable

## Usage

Just ask: "Generate commit message" or "What should I commit?"

I'll review staged changes and create a proper message.
