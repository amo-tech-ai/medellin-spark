## 🎬 Demo Usage

### Using the Skill

**Trigger via Claude Code:**
```
User: "Test the pitch deck wizard"
Claude: [Loads playwright-e2e skill and runs pitch-deck-wizard playbook]
```

**Manual playbook execution:**
```bash
npx @playwright/mcp --headless < playbooks/pitch-deck-wizard.md
```

### Using the Agent

**Trigger phrases:**
- "test the full user journey"
- "run e2e tests"
- "validate pitch deck wizard"
- "run smoke tests"

**Programmatic usage:**
```typescript
import { EventosPlaywrightAgent } from '.claude/agents/eventos-playwright-agent';

const agent = new EventosPlaywrightAgent({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  timeout: 30000
});

const result = await agent.runPitchDeckJourney(context);
console.log(agent.generateReport([result]));
```
