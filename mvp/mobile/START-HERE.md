## Questions?

- **Do I need Week 0 (Prerequisites)?** No, you already have viewport tag
- **Do I need Week 6.5 (Accessibility)?** Only if deploying to EU
- **Do I need Week 7 (Deployment)?** Only if doing gradual rollout
- **Do I need analytics?** Only if you want to measure metrics

**For MVP: Just do Weeks 1-6.**
