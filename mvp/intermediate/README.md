## ⚠️ Important Notes

### When to Build Intermediate Features

**✅ Build these when:**
- Core MVP is live and stable
- You have 100+ active users
- Users are asking for these features
- Core features are performing well

**❌ Don't build these when:**
- Core MVP not shipped yet
- No user traction
- Core features have bugs
- Team is small (< 2 people)

### Feature Maturity Levels

**100% Complete (Perks)**:
- Already serving users
- Just needs maintenance
- Can use as reference implementation

**80%+ Complete (Dashboard, Jobs)**:
- Nearly ready to ship
- Just needs final polish
- Can complete in days not weeks

## 🎓 Why "Intermediate"?

These features are called "intermediate" because:

1. **Timing**: Build after core proves PMF
2. **Complexity**: More complex than core CRUD
3. **Value**: Drive growth, not initial validation
4. **Dependencies**: Require core to be working

**They're NOT "intermediate difficulty"** - some are 100% complete!

---

## 🔄 Migration from Core

Some features started in core but belong here:

- **Dashboard**: User retention feature, not MVP-critical
- **Jobs**: Growth feature, not core product
- **Testing**: Continuous, not one-time setup

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

**If Core is Complete:**
1. Start with `01-dashboard/` (highest user impact)
2. Verify `02-perks/` is performing well
3. Complete `03-jobs-stage1/` (3-day sprint)
4. Use `04-testing/` continuously

**If Core Not Complete:**
→ Go back to `../core/` and finish it first
