## 🔍 Verification Results

### TypeScript Check ✅

## 📦 Backup Information

**Location**: `~/backups/taskmaster-backup-20251019-171146.tar.gz`  
**Size**: 146 KB  
**Contains**: All removed Task Master files

### Restore (If Needed)
```bash
cd /home/sk/medellin-spark
tar -xzf ~/backups/taskmaster-backup-*.tar.gz

# Re-add task-master-ai to .cursor/mcp.json
# Restart Cursor
```

---

## 🎯 Why This Was Safe

### No Application Dependencies
```bash
# Task Master was NOT in package.json
grep "task-master" package.json
# Result: No matches ✅

# Task Master was NOT imported anywhere
grep -r "task-master\|taskmaster" src/ supabase/
# Result: No matches ✅
```

### Independent Tool
Task Master is a **development workflow aid**, not a runtime dependency:
- ❌ Not used by React app
- ❌ Not used by Supabase
- ❌ Not used by build process
- ❌ Not used by tests
- ✅ Only used for task management (optional)
