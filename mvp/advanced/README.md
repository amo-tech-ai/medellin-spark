## 📊 Complexity & Effort

| Feature | Complexity | Effort | ROI | Build When |
|---------|------------|--------|-----|------------|
| **Jobs AI** | ⭐⭐⭐ High | 3 weeks | High | Month 2 |
| **Business Plan AI** | ⭐⭐ Medium | 2-4 weeks | Very High | Month 3 |
| **Multi-Agent** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High | 1-2 months | Medium | Future |
| **Integrations** | ⭐⭐ Medium | 1 week each | High (LATAM) | As needed |

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Building Too Early
**Problem**: Build advanced features before PMF  
**Result**: Wasted time, distracted focus  
**Fix**: Only build after 500+ users demand it

### Mistake #2: Over-Engineering
**Problem**: Build multi-agent system for simple task  
**Result**: Complex code, slow development  
**Fix**: Start simple, add complexity when needed

### Mistake #3: Ignoring User Demand
**Problem**: Build what's cool vs what users want  
**Result**: Low adoption, wasted effort  
**Fix**: Let users tell you what to build

## 📖 How to Use This Folder

### For Product Managers
→ Review to understand future roadmap  
→ Don't promise these features to users yet  
→ Wait for clear demand signals

### For Developers
→ Read for technical context  
→ Don't start coding yet  
→ Focus on core and intermediate first

### For Stakeholders
→ Understand long-term vision  
→ These features = Month 6+ timeline  
→ Core + intermediate = Month 1-3 focus

---

## 🔄 Graduation from Intermediate

Features move from intermediate → advanced when:

**Example: Jobs**
- **Stage 1** (Intermediate): Basic job posting, applications
- **Stages 2-5** (Advanced): AI screening, matching, outreach

**When to Graduate:**
- Stage 1 is live and stable
- Users demanding AI features
- Clear ROI on AI investment
- Team ready for complexity

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't Rush**: Advanced features are called "advanced" for a reason
2. **User-Driven**: Build what users request, not what's cool
3. **Incremental**: Add complexity gradually
4. **Test First**: Validate with small experiments
5. **Measure ROI**: Every advanced feature should drive growth
