## 🔴 NOT STARTED / NEEDS COMPLETION (8 items)

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- 🔴 **Profile lookup bug** - generate-pitch-deck/index.ts:127-131
  - Issue: Looks up profile by user_id instead of accepting profile_id
  - Impact: HIGH - Won't work for authenticated users
  - Fix Time: 5 minutes
  - Code:
  ```typescript
  // ❌ CURRENT (WRONG)
  .eq('user_id', user_id)

  // ✅ SHOULD BE
  .eq('id', profile_id)
  ```

- 🔴 **Inconsistent dev UUIDs** - Multiple files
  - Issue: PitchDeckWizard uses different UUID than usePresentationQuery
  - Files:
    - PitchDeckWizard.tsx:65 = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
    - usePresentationQuery.ts:35 = '5178cb19-00e4-4b2e-ba25-66776c17c99a'
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Dev mode inconsistent
  - Fix Time: 10 minutes

- 🔴 **Test presentation not public** - Database record
  - Issue: Test presentation d4a27c1c-8b2d-48a9-99c9-2298037e9e81 not marked public
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Slide grid won't load for testing
  - Fix Time: 2 minutes (SQL UPDATE)

### Testing Gaps
- 🔴 **End-to-end testing** - Full flow not tested
  - Missing: Chat → Generate → View slides flow
  - Impact: HIGH - Unknown if system works completely
  - Fix Time: 60 minutes

- 🔴 **Authentication flow testing** - Real user testing
  - Missing: Sign in/out, user-specific data
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Can't verify auth works
  - Fix Time: 30 minutes

### Production Requirements
- 🔴 **Production build** - Build not tested
  - Missing: `pnpm build` verification
  - Impact: HIGH - Unknown if production build works
  - Fix Time: 15 minutes

- 🔴 **Environment variables validation** - Startup checks
  - Missing: Required env var validation in Edge Functions
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Silent failures possible
  - Fix Time: 15 minutes

- 🔴 **Observability/Logging** - No structured logging
  - Missing: Error tracking, usage analytics
  - Impact: LOW - Can't debug production issues
  - Fix Time: 60 minutes

## 🚨 RED FLAGS & CRITICAL ISSUES

### 🔥 BLOCKERS (Fix Immediately)

1. **Profile Lookup Bug** (generate-pitch-deck)
   - Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL
   - When: Will fail on first real user test
   - Fix: Change `.eq('user_id', user_id)` to accept profile_id directly

2. **No End-to-End Testing**
   - Severity: 🔴 CRITICAL
   - Risk: System may not work end-to-end
   - Fix: Run full flow test before deploying

3. **Test Data Not Public**
   - Severity: 🟡 HIGH
   - Impact: Can't test slide grid rendering
   - Fix: `UPDATE presentations SET is_public = true WHERE id = 'd4a27c1c-8b2d-48a9-99c9-2298037e9e81'`

### ⚠️ WARNINGS (Fix Before Production)

1. **Inconsistent Dev UUIDs**
   - Impact: Dev mode unreliable
   - Fix: Standardize on one UUID

2. **No Production Build Test**
   - Impact: Build might fail in production
   - Fix: Run `pnpm build` and test

3. **Missing Observability**
   - Impact: Can't debug production issues
   - Fix: Add structured logging
