## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Immediate Fixes (2-4 hours)

**Step 1:** Read EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md (5 minutes)
**Step 2:** Open QUICK-START-FIXES.md
**Step 3:** Follow Fix #1 through Fix #5
**Step 4:** Test and verify

**Result:** Functional presentation system

---

### For Complete Implementation (1-2 weeks)

**Phase 1: Critical Fixes** (2-4 hours)
- Follow QUICK-START-FIXES.md
- Get frontend functional

**Phase 2: Complete Editor** (3-5 days)
- Read LOVABLE-UI-UX-PROMPT.md sections on:
  - Page 3: Presentation Editor
  - Drag & drop implementation
  - Auto-save setup
- Build outline editor
- Build content editor

**Phase 3: Complete Viewer** (1-2 days)
- Read LOVABLE-UI-UX-PROMPT.md section:
  - Page 4: Presentation Viewer
- Build full-screen viewer
- Add keyboard navigation
- Add share/export

**Phase 4: Polish** (2-3 days)
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Mobile responsive
- Testing

**Result:** Production-ready system

---

### For AI-Assisted Development (Lovable)

**Give Lovable this prompt:**
```
Read /home/sk/medellin-spark/lovable-plan/LOVABLE-UI-UX-PROMPT.md

This is a complete UI/UX design specification for an AI-powered
pitch deck generator.

Start with Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) from the document, then proceed
through Phase 2 (Complete Editor), Phase 3 (Complete Viewer), and
Phase 4 (Polish).

Follow the exact component structures, styling classes, and interaction
patterns specified. Use the existing design system (colors, typography,
spacing) detailed in the "Design System & Brand Guidelines" section.

Implement each page exactly as specified in the "Page-by-Page UI
Specifications" section with the provided component code examples.

Test against the "Success Criteria" checklist before marking complete.
```

**Result:** Lovable builds entire system following specs
