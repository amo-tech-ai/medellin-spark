## 📋 Organization Decision Matrix

### Core Dashboard Features (Keep in main folder)
**What**: Implementation-ready documentation
**Where**: `/mvp/core/dashboard/`
**Files**: 001-006 + DASHBOARD_SUPABASE_AUDIT.md + README.md

✅ **001-DASHBOARD-PAGES-PLAN.md** - Page structure
✅ **002-DASHBOARD-COMPREHENSIVE-PLAN.md** - Technical architecture
✅ **003-DASHBOARD-IMPLEMENTATION-TASKS.md** - Task breakdown
✅ **004-DASHBOARD-TESTING-STRATEGY.md** - Testing approach
✅ **005-DASHBOARD-WORKFLOW-STEPS.md** - Development workflow
✅ **006-SUPABASE-REACT-BEST-PRACTICES.md** - Best practices
✅ **DASHBOARD_SUPABASE_AUDIT.md** - Current state
✅ **README.md** - Navigation hub

---

### Reference Material (Move to /mvp/core/05-reference/)
**What**: Research, UI/UX patterns, design inspiration
**Why**: Valuable but not implementation docs
**Files**: 3 from 01-dashboard/

📁 **03-dashboard-layouts.md** → `/mvp/core/05-reference/dashboard-ui-layouts.md`
   - Stakeholder personas
   - ASCII art UI layouts
   - Design specifications

📁 **16-decktopus-mvp-startup-pitch.md** → `/mvp/core/05-reference/decktopus-competitor-analysis.md`
   - Competitor research
   - Feature comparison
   - MVP insights

📁 **17-decktopus-integration-guide.md** → `/mvp/core/05-reference/decktopus-ui-patterns.md`
   - UI/UX design patterns
   - Visual analysis
   - Integration ideas

---

### Duplicates/Outdated (Move to /mvp/notes/)
**What**: Duplicate or superseded content
**Why**: Covered by newer docs, keep for historical reference
**Files**: 5 from 01-dashboard/

🗑️ **01-dashboard-plan.md** → `/mvp/notes/dashboard-plan-old-v1.md`
🗑️ **09-DASHBOARD_PLAN.md** → Delete (exact duplicate)
🗑️ **02-my-presentations.md** → `/mvp/notes/my-presentations-old.md`
🗑️ **04-my-presentations-page-plan.md** → `/mvp/notes/my-presentations-plan-old.md`
🗑️ **README.md** (nested) → Delete (superseded)
