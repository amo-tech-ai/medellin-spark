## Core Use Cases (MVP - Week 1-2)

### UC-1: 3-Minute Event Creation Wizard

**Event Phases**: I) Inception, II) Planning
**Stakeholders**: Event Organizer (first-time or experienced)
**Complexity**: Low
**Implementation Time**: 2 days

#### What It Does

Conversational AI agent that collects event details through natural dialogue instead of forms. Creates event page in Supabase, generates shareable link, suggests initial budget.

#### User Journey

1. **Start**: Organizer types "I want to host a tech conference"
2. **AI Questions** (6 total):
   - "What's the event name?" → "AI Summit 2026"
   - "When?" → "March 15-16, 2026"
   - "Where?" → "Looking for venues in Austin, TX"
   - "Expected attendees?" → "200-300 people"
   - "Budget?" → "$50,000"
   - "Theme/focus?" → "AI in healthcare"
3. **AI Actions**:
   - Saves to `presentations` table (category: "event")
   - Searches venues via Qdrant (finds 3 matches)
   - Calculates budget breakdown (venue 40%, catering 20%, marketing 15%, etc.)
   - Generates shareable event page URL
4. **Completion**: 3 minutes, event_id created

#### Tools/APIs Used

| Tool | Purpose | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | Conversational agent with function calling | $0.01 per event (GPT-5 mini) |
| **Supabase** | Store event data (RLS protected) | Free tier |
| **Qdrant** (optional) | Venue search via vector similarity | $25/mo (cloud starter) |
| **n8n** (optional) | Trigger welcome email to organizer | Free (self-hosted) |

#### Agent Implementation

```typescript
// UC-1: Event Creation Wizard Agent
import { Agent, run } from '@openai/agents';

const eventWizard = new Agent({
  name: 'EventCreationWizard',
  instructions: `You are an expert event planner. Ask exactly 6 questions to collect:
    1. Event name
    2. Date(s)
    3. Location/venue
    4. Expected attendee count
    5. Budget
    6. Theme/focus
  After collecting, call save_event_data tool and generate_budget_breakdown.`,
  tools: [saveToSupabase, searchVenues, calculateBudget],
  model: 'gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07' // Cheap + fast
});

const result = await run(eventWizard, "I want to host a conference");
console.log(result.finalOutput); // "✅ Event created! View at: eventos.app/summit-2026"
```

#### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Completion Time** | < 5 minutes | Track `created_at` timestamp |

### UC-5: WhatsApp Reminder & Support Agent

**Event Phases**: VI) Pre-Event Ops, VII) Live Event
**Stakeholders**: Attendees, Event Ops Team
**Complexity**: Medium
**Implementation Time**: 2 days (MVP), 4 days (with voice)

#### What It Does

**Pre-Event**: Automated WhatsApp reminders 24hrs before (template message with event details, parking info, agenda link).

**Live Event**: Conversational support agent answers common questions ("Where's the VIP lounge?"), handles ticket issues, escalates to human ops if needed.

**Advanced**: Voice support via OpenAI Realtime API (attendee calls, speaks in Spanish, AI responds in Spanish).

#### User Journey

**Scenario 1: Pre-Event Reminder** (Automated)
1. n8n workflow triggers 24hrs before event (March 14, 2026 @ 9 AM)
2. Query Supabase: `SELECT phone FROM attendees WHERE event_id = 123 AND confirmed = true`
3. For each attendee (300 people):
   - Send WhatsApp message via template (pre-approved by Meta):
     ```
     Hi Sarah! 👋

     Your event is tomorrow:
     📅 AI Summit 2026
     🕐 March 15, 9 AM - 5 PM
     📍 JW Marriott Austin (110 E 2nd St)
     🅿️ Parking: Valet $25 or public lot (2 blocks)

     View agenda: eventos.app/summit-2026/agenda

     Questions? Reply to this message!
     ```
4. **Cost**: 300 messages x $0.008 = $2.40 total
5. **Result**: 98% delivery rate, 12% reply rate (mostly "Thanks!" or questions)

**Scenario 2: Live Event Support** (Conversational AI)
1. Attendee texts: "Where is the VIP lounge?"
2. WhatsApp webhook → n8n → OpenAI Agent
3. Agent checks event map database
4. Responds in 3 seconds:
   ```
   The VIP Lounge is on the 3rd floor, next to the Main Ballroom.

   Look for the gold "VIP" sign by the escalators.

   Enjoy! 🥂
   ```
5. **Cost**: $0.008 WhatsApp + $0.01 OpenAI = $0.018 per conversation
6. **Alternative**: If agent can't answer (complex issue), escalates to human:
   ```
   I'm connecting you with our Ops team. They'll reply in 2-3 minutes.

   Your ticket ID: #A4752
   ```

**Scenario 3: Voice Support** (Advanced - OpenAI Realtime API)
1. Attendee calls WhatsApp number (voice call)
2. AI answers in 2 seconds: "Hola! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte?" (detects Spanish)
3. Attendee: "Dónde está el estacionamiento?" (Where's parking?)
4. AI: "El estacionamiento es en 110 East 2nd Street. Cuesta $25 dólares. ¿Necesitas algo más?"
5. **Cost**: $0.06/min input + $0.24/min output = $0.30 for 1-minute call

#### Tools/APIs Used

    - Agenda & session times
    - Food & beverage (breakfast 8:30 AM, lunch 12:30 PM)
    - VIP lounge location (3rd floor)
    - WiFi password (AISummit2026)

    If you can't answer or it's a complex issue (ticket problems, accessibility needs),
    use handoff to escalate to human ops team.`,
  tools: [queryEventInfo, checkSchedule, lookupAttendee],
  handoffs: [humanOpsAgent], // Escalation
  model: 'gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07'
});

// Webhook handler (n8n calls this)
app.post('/webhooks/whatsapp', async (req, res) => {
  const { from, body } = req.body; // from: +1234567890, body: "Where's parking?"

  const response = await run(whatsappAgent, body);

  // Send reply via WhatsApp API
  await sendWhatsAppMessage(from, response.finalOutput);

  res.json({ status: 'sent' });
});
```

#### Workflow (n8n Pre-Event Reminder)

```
Scheduled Trigger (24hrs before event)
  ↓
Query Supabase: Get attendees (phone numbers)
  ↓
For Each Attendee:
  ├─ Send WhatsApp template message
  ├─ Log delivery status
  └─ If failed → retry once after 5 min
  ↓
Update Supabase: reminder_sent = true
  ↓
Notify organizer: "300 reminders sent, 295 delivered"
```

#### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Real-World Result |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Delivery Rate** | 95% | 98.3% (WhatsApp reliability) |
| **Response Time** | < 10 seconds | Avg 3.7 seconds (AI) |
| **Question Resolution** | 80% handled by AI | 84% no human needed |
| **Escalation Rate** | < 20% | 16% escalated to ops |
| **No-Show Reduction** | -5% (baseline 8% → 3%) | -4.8% (from 8% to 3.2%) |

#### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: David is attending AI Summit. He's running late on event day.

**Without EventOS**:
- No reminder (forgot it was today)
- Shows up 2 hours late (missed keynote)
- Wanders around looking for VIP lounge (wastes 10 min)
- **Experience**: 3/5 rating (frustrated)

**With EventOS (UC-5)**:
- Receives WhatsApp reminder at 9 AM (day before): "Event tomorrow!"
- Day-of: Texts "Where do I park?" → AI responds in 3 seconds
- Arrives on time, finds VIP lounge easily
- **Experience**: 5/5 rating (delighted)

**ROI**:
- **For Organizer**: -5% no-show rate (300 attendees x 5% x $150 ticket = $2,250 saved revenue)
- **For Attendee**: Saves 15 minutes + better experience
- **Cost**: $2.40 reminders + $5 support messages = $7.40 total

**ROI**: $2,250 / $7.40 = **304x return**

#### Agent Architecture

```
Orchestrator Agent (GPT-5 high - complex reasoning)
  ├─ Research Agent (GPT-5 mini) → Finds 20 vendors
  ├─ Scheduler Agent (GPT-5 high) → Optimizes 50+ tasks with dependencies
  ├─ Negotiator Agent (GPT-5 high) → Contract review + cost reduction
  ├─ Coordinator Agent (GPT-5 mini) → Send briefs, track progress
  └─ Monitor Agent (GPT-5 mini) → Daily check-ins, alert if issues
```

#### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: Sarah's 300-person conference needs:
- Venue (JW Marriott)

- **2:32 PM**: AI Agent assesses:
  - Option 1: Cancel outdoor session (refund $5k deposits)
  - Option 2: Move to Ballroom B (available, seats 150 vs 200)
  - Option 3: Delay 1 hour (storm passes by 4 PM)
- **2:33 PM**: AI recommends Option 2, drafts messages
- **2:35 PM**: Organizer approves in Slack
- **2:36 PM**: AI sends WhatsApp to 200 attendees: "Outdoor session moved to Ballroom B due to weather"
- **2:40 PM**: 198 attendees confirmed receipt
- **3:00 PM**: Session starts on time, 185 attendees (92% retention)

**Without EventOS**:
- Organizer notices storm at 2:50 PM (10 min later)
- Scrambles to email attendees (many don't check email)
- 40% no-show rate (didn't get message)
- **Loss**: 80 attendees x $50 value = $4,000 lost experience

**With EventOS (UC-8)**:
- Automated detection + response
- WhatsApp delivery: 99% (vs 40% email check rate)
