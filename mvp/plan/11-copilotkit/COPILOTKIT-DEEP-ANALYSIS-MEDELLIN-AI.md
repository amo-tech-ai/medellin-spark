- Worth the extra setup time

### 3. Real-Time is Powerful
- AG-UI protocol for anything user-facing
- Mastra for coordinating multiple agents
- WebSocket/SSE for live progress
- Users love seeing agents "think"

### 4. RAG for Knowledge
- LlamaIndex for any "chat with your data" feature
- Founders have questions → Resource library has answers
- Better than fine-tuning (easier to update)

### 5. Crews for Quality
- Multiple agents review each other's work
- Reduces hallucinations
- Simulates expert team
- Worth higher cost for critical decisions

## 🚫 What NOT to Use

### Avoid for MVP
- ❌ Google ADK (enterprise, expensive, Google lock-in)
- ❌ AG2 (code execution security concerns)
- ❌ Complex multi-agent for simple tasks

### Avoid for Pitch Deck Wizard
- ❌ ANY framework migration
- ❌ CrewAI (overkill for single task)
- ❌ Mastra (don't need orchestration for 1 agent)

**Reason**: Your custom implementation is 85% done and works great!

## 📋 Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Chat (Pitch Deck ← Current)
```
User → CopilotKit UI → Direct LLM API → Response
```
**Use when**: Single task, no complex logic

### Pattern 2: Validated Agent (Event Form)
```
User → CopilotKit UI → Pydantic AI Agent → Validated Output
```
**Use when**: Need structured, validated data

### Pattern 3: RAG Knowledge (Resource Library)
```
User Question → LlamaIndex RAG → Relevant Docs → LLM + Context → Answer
```
**Use when**: Large knowledge base to search

### Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Workflow (Event Planning)
```
User Request → Mastra Orchestrator → [Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3] → Combined Result
```
**Use when**: Complex task needs multiple specialists

### Pattern 5: Agent Crew (Advisory Board)
```
User Question → CEO Agent → [CTO, CMO, CFO Agents] → Discussion → Consensus
```
**Use when**: Need multi-perspective analysis
