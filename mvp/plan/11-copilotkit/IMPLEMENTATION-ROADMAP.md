## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Qdrant Knowledge Base Quality

**Risk**: Best practices data is low quality or biased
**Mitigation**:
- Source from reputable organizations (YC, Sequoia, 500 Startups)
- Include diverse examples (100+ startups across industries)
- Add confidence scores (high/medium/low)
- Allow user feedback ("Was this helpful?")
- Iterate based on results

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation Effort**: Low (ongoing curation)

### Risk 2: OpenAI Cost Overruns

**Risk**: Unexpected API cost spikes
**Mitigation**:
- Set billing alerts ($100, $500, $1000)
- Implement rate limiting (max 10 queries/user/hour)
- Cache common responses
- Use gpt-4o-mini (96% cheaper than GPT-4)
- Monitor usage daily

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Effort**: Low (configuration)

### Risk 3: Performance Degradation

**Risk**: System slows down with scale
**Mitigation**:
- Load test before launch (1000 concurrent users)
- Add CDN (Cloudflare) for static assets
- Optimize Qdrant queries (indexing, caching)
- Use Supabase connection pooling
- Monitor response times (alert if >3s)

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation Effort**: Medium (optimization)

### Risk 4: User Adoption

**Risk**: Users don't understand new features
**Mitigation**:
- Add onboarding tutorial (interactive walkthrough)
- Show tooltips for new features
- Create demo video (2-3 minutes)
- Offer chat support for first week
- Collect feedback and iterate

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation Effort**: Medium (UX improvements)
