## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Rebuild Pitch Deck
- Current custom implementation: 85% done, works great
- Any framework migration: 2-4 weeks wasted
- Cost: $9,000-21,000 to rebuild
- Result: Same functionality, more complexity

### ❌ Don't Use ChatKit
- Vendor lock-in to OpenAI
- 10x higher costs ($595-2,275/month)
- Backend still your responsibility
- CopilotKit is better in every way

### ❌ Don't Use Google ADK (Yet)
- Enterprise-focused (you're MVP stage)
- Google Cloud vendor lock-in
- Expensive ($$$)
- Wait until enterprise clients demand it

## 🎯 Strategic Pattern

**Simple → Complex → Premium**

```
Month 1: Custom chat (simple, fast, cheap)
Month 2: LlamaIndex RAG (medium complexity, high value)
Month 3-4: Mastra multi-agent (complex, premium feature)
Month 5-6: CrewAI crews (very complex, enterprise feature)
```

**Revenue Pattern**:
```
Free: Simple features (pitch deck wizard)
Premium ($99/mo): Multi-agent features (event planning)
