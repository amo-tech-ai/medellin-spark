# Medellin AI - Complete System Plan Reorganization

**Date**: January 20, 2025
**Purpose**: Reorganize plan folder for complete Medellin AI startup system
**Goal**: Natural language progression from core setup → advanced features

---

## 🎯 Current Issues

1. **README outdated** - Only describes pitch-deck and dashboard, not all features
2. **Missing structure** - Jobs AI, Perks, Business Plan lack core/intermediate/advanced organization
3. **Mixed content** - Research/reference materials mixed with implementation guides
4. **Loose files** - `04-server-start.md` not in proper folder
5. **Duplicates** - `05-pitch-deck` has both `01-core.md` and `01-pitch-deck-core.md`
6. **No clear order** - Unclear which feature to implement first

---

## ✨ Proposed Structure

### Implementation Folders (Numbered - Build in This Order)

Each folder contains: `01-core.md`, `02-intermediate.md`, `03-advanced.md`

```
