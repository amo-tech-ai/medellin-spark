```

**Recommended Fixes:**

### Test 10: Console Errors 🟡 MINOR WARNINGS

**Error Details:**
```javascript
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key
Component: Footer navigation lists
Location:
  - at ul
  - at div
  - at footer
  - at Footer
```

**Impact:**
- Does NOT break functionality ✅
- Does NOT crash app ✅
- May cause minor rendering issues
- Should be fixed for code quality

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// Footer component needs unique keys for list items
// Current: Likely using index as key
// Fix: Use item.url or item.id as key

// Example:
links.map((link, index) => <li key={index}>) // ❌ Bad
links.map((link) => <li key={link.url}>)     // ✅ Good
```

**Status:** 🟡 **PASS WITH WARNINGS** - Non-blocking, cosmetic fix needed
