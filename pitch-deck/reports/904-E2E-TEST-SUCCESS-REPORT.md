## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### Issue #1: 401 Authentication Error (pitch-deck-assistant)
**Problem**: Edge Function required `profile_id`, blocked dev mode
**Fix**: Added dev mode detection, fallback to dev UUID
**File**: `supabase/functions/pitch-deck-assistant/index.ts:66-110`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #2: Frontend Parameter Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend sent `user_id`, backend expected `profile_id`
**Fix**: Changed parameter name in PitchDeckWizard.tsx:141
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #3: 401 Error (generate-pitch-deck)
**Problem**: Same auth blocking in generate function
**Fix**: Added dev mode bypass logic
**File**: `supabase/functions/generate-pitch-deck/index.ts:63-69`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #4: Foreign Key Constraint
**Problem**: Dev UUID doesn't exist in profiles table
**Fix**: Query for existing profile, use real ID in dev mode
**File**: `supabase/functions/generate-pitch-deck/index.ts:135-146`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue #5: RLS Blocking Presentation View
**Problem**: Created presentation not publicly accessible
**Fix**: Mark dev presentations as `is_public: true`
**File**: `supabase/functions/generate-pitch-deck/index.ts:161`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
