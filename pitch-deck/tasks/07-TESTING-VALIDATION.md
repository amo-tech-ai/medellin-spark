2. User: "We solve the problem of slow code reviews using AI"
   ‚Üí AI should ask about solution/market

3. User: "Our target market is software development teams at tech companies"
   ‚Üí AI should ask about business model

4. User: "We charge $50/user/month"
   ‚Üí Progress should be 60%+, Generate button appears
```

**Verify**:
- [ ] Messages appear in chat
- [ ] AI responds appropriately

SELECT id, title, slide_count, status
FROM presentations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

FROM pitch_conversations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

python3 -c "from src.agent import agent"
```

### Frontend Shows DISABLED Message

grep "EDGE_FUNCTIONS_DISABLED" src/pages/PitchDeckWizard.tsx
# Should show: const EDGE_FUNCTIONS_DISABLED = false;
```

### AI Not Responding
```bash
# Check backend logs
# Verify WebSocket connection in browser dev tools
```

### Generate Deck Fails
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify Supabase connection
# Check backend database module
```
