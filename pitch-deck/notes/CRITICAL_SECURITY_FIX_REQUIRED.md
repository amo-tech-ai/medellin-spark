# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY VULNERABILITY DETECTED

**Status:** RLS (Row Level Security) is currently DISABLED on presentations tables  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Private presentations are publicly accessible without authentication  
**Risk:** Anyone can read ALL presentations (including private ones)  

## üìä Current State

Test results show:
- ‚úÖ RLS policies exist (properly configured)
- ‚ùå RLS is DISABLED on all tables (temporary bypass active)
- üî¥ 4 private presentations are readable without auth
- üî¥ Anyone can access data that should be protected

## üîç Why This Happened

A temporary auth bypass migration was applied for development:
- File: `supabase/migrations/20251014200000_temporary_auth_bypass.sql`
- Purpose: Allow testing without auth provider setup
- Status: **STILL ACTIVE** (forgot to revert)

## ‚úÖ How to Fix (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk/sql/new

(You'll need to sign in with your Supabase account)

### Step 2: Run the Fix SQL

Open the file `FIX_RLS_NOW.sql` in this directory and copy its contents.

Or copy this SQL directly:

```sql
-- Re-enable RLS on all presentation tables
ALTER TABLE presentations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE presentation_templates ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE custom_themes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE generated_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE favorite_presentations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop temporary permissive policies on profiles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_select_all_temporary" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_insert_anon_temporary" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_update_anon_temporary" ON profiles;

-- Restore normal profile policies
CREATE POLICY "profiles_select_public"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_own"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_own"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());
```

Paste into the SQL Editor and click **"Run"**.

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After running the SQL, verify RLS is working:

```bash
node scripts/check-public-presentations.cjs
```

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ RLS IS WORKING CORRECTLY
   Only public presentations are readable without auth
   This is the EXPECTED behavior
```

## üìù Alternative: Apply via Migration File

You can also run the existing migration file in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Open: `supabase/migrations/20251014200001_revert_auth_bypass.sql`
2. Copy entire contents
3. Paste in SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dhesktsqhcxhqfjypulk/sql/new
4. Click "Run"

## üîê What This Fix Does

1. **Enables RLS** on 5 tables:
   - `presentations` - User presentations
   - `presentation_templates` - Template library
   - `custom_themes` - User themes
   - `generated_images` - AI images
   - `favorite_presentations` - Favorites

2. **Restores Normal Auth**:
   - Users can only see their own presentations (or public ones)
   - Authentication required for writes
   - Removes temporary bypass policies

3. **Makes System Production-Ready**:
   - Private data protected
   - Authentication enforced
   - Security policies active

## üß™ Verification Scripts

After applying the fix, run these verification scripts:

### Check RLS Status
```bash
node scripts/check-and-fix-rls.cjs
```

### Verify Enforcement
```bash
node scripts/verify-rls-enforcement.cjs
```

### Check Public Status
```bash
node scripts/check-public-presentations.cjs
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time to Fix

**5 minutes** - This is a quick fix with massive security impact!

## üìã Next Steps After Fix

Once RLS is enabled, the application will require proper authentication:

1. ‚úÖ Security will be restored
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features may break (they use mock data)
3. üîÑ Need to connect UI to real database (next tasks)
4. üß™ End-to-end testing with real auth

## üöÄ Priority

**FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE CONTINUING WITH OTHER TASKS**

This is a blocking security issue. All other development work should wait until RLS is properly enabled.

## üìû Questions?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check Supabase Dashboard for error messages
2. Review the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251014200001_revert_auth_bypass.sql`
3. Verify database connection in `.env` and `.env.admin`

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After fix is applied:
- [ ] RLS enabled on all 5 tables
- [ ] Private presentations NOT readable without auth
- [ ] Public presentations ARE readable (expected)
- [ ] Insert/update requires authentication
- [ ] Verification scripts pass
