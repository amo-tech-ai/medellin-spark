## üéØ WHAT IS CLAUDE AGENT SDK

### The Fundamental Difference

**Regular Claude API**:
- Simple request ‚Üí response
- No memory between calls
- No access to external tools
- Static: one prompt, one answer

**Claude Agent SDK**:
- Continuous conversation loop
- Maintains context across interactions
- Can call external tools and functions
- Dynamic: gathers context ‚Üí takes action ‚Üí verifies work ‚Üí repeats

### The Agent Loop

Think of it like a smart intern working on your pitch deck:

1. **Gather Context**: "What information do I need?" (researches market data, competitor info)
2. **Take Action**: "Let me create this slide" (writes content, fetches images)
3. **Verify Work**: "Does this make sense?" (checks facts, validates structure)
4. **Repeat**: "What's next?" (moves to next slide, refines previous work)

### Key Innovation

Instead of treating Claude as a text generator, the SDK treats it as an **autonomous agent with access to a toolbox**. It can:

- Search the web for market data
- Query databases for company information
- Fetch financial projections
- Generate and validate images
- Save work incrementally
- Self-correct mistakes

---

## üß© CORE CONCEPTS

### 1. Sessions

**What it is**: A continuous conversation that remembers everything.

**How it works**:
- User starts: "Create pitch deck for AI event platform"
- Claude asks clarifying questions
- User provides company details
- Claude remembers all context for next steps
- Can pause and resume later
- Can fork (create branches) to explore alternatives

**Real-world example**:
> Founder starts session Monday: "I need a pitch deck for investors."
> Claude asks about company, market, competitors.
> Founder provides info but has to leave.
> Tuesday: Founder resumes session, Claude remembers everything.
> Generates deck with full context from Monday.

### 2. Tools

**What it is**: Functions that Claude can call when it needs external capabilities.

**Types of tools**:
- **Research tools**: Fetch market size, competitor data, industry trends
- **Data tools**: Calculate financial projections, growth rates
- **Creative tools**: Generate images, suggest color palettes
- **Storage tools**: Save drafts to database, load previous decks
- **Export tools**: Convert to PDF, PPTX, or shareable link

**Philosophy** (from Anthropic's guide):
> Tools are NOT just API wrappers. They're carefully designed actions that give Claude superpowers while keeping things safe and predictable.

**Example tool flow**:
1. User: "Include market size for event tech in Latin America"
2. Claude thinks: "I need market data"
3. Calls `market_research_tool` with parameters: `{industry: "event tech", region: "latam"}`
4. Tool returns: `{tam: "$2.5B", sam: "$450M", growth: "18% YoY"}`
5. Claude incorporates into slide 4 (Market Opportunity)

### 3. Subagents

**What it is**: Specialized mini-agents that handle specific tasks in parallel.

**Why it matters**:
- **Prevents context overload**: Main agent delegates work to specialists
- **Enables parallelization**: Research agent + design agent + financial agent work simultaneously
- **Maintains focus**: Each agent has its own expertise and tools

**Real-world example for pitch decks**:

**Main Agent** (orchestrator):
- Understands user's startup vision
- Decides what information is needed
- Coordinates subagents
- Assembles final deck

**Research Subagent**:
- Has access to web search, databases
- Gathers market data, competitor info
- Returns structured insights

**Financial Subagent**:
- Has access to calculation tools
- Projects revenue, burn rate, runway
- Returns validated numbers

**Design Subagent**:
- Has access to image generation, templates
- Creates visual assets, color schemes
- Returns design assets

**Content Subagent**:
- Has access to writing guidelines
- Crafts compelling narratives
- Returns slide copy optimized for investors

### 4. Streaming

**What it is**: Results arrive in real-time as Claude works, not all at once.

**Why it's powerful**:
- User sees progress (slide 1 complete... slide 2 in progress...)
- Can interrupt if direction is wrong
- Feels fast (instant feedback vs. waiting 2 minutes)
- Can approve/reject slides as they're generated

**User experience**:
```
[‚è≥] Researching market data...
[‚úÖ] Market research complete: $2.5B TAM, 18% growth
[‚è≥] Writing Problem slide...
[‚úÖ] Problem slide ready: "Event organizers waste 40 hours on manual tasks"
[‚è≥] Generating solution diagram...
[‚úÖ] Solution slide ready with AI workflow visual
[‚è≥] Calculating financial projections...
```

### 5. Permissions

**What it is**: Fine-grained control over what Claude can and cannot do.

**Permission levels**:
- **Read only**: Can view data but not modify
- **Write with approval**: Must ask permission before saving
- **Auto-approve safe actions**: Can create slides freely
- **Restricted zones**: Cannot access financial data without explicit permission

**Security example**:
- ‚úÖ Allowed: Generate slide content, fetch market data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires approval: Save to database, send emails
- ‚ùå Blocked: Delete existing decks, modify user profiles

## üöÄ WHY USE IT FOR PITCH DECKS

### Problem with Traditional AI

**Current approach** (simple API call):
- User: "Create pitch deck for AI event platform"
- AI: Generates generic 10 slides with invented facts
- User: "Add market data"
- AI: Makes up numbers (no real research)
- User: "Fix slide 3"
- AI: Doesn't remember context from previous slides

### Agent SDK Solution

**Intelligent approach**:
- User: "Create pitch deck for AI event platform in Medell√≠n"
- Agent: "Let me research the event tech market in Latin America..."
  - Calls `market_research_tool`
  - Finds real TAM/SAM/SOM data
- Agent: "Found 3 main competitors. Let me analyze them..."
  - Calls `competitor_analysis_tool`
  - Returns Hopin vs. Brella vs. Eventbrite comparison
- Agent: "Based on your $15/user pricing, here are projections..."
  - Calls `financial_projection_tool`
  - Calculates realistic 3-year growth
- Agent: "I'll use the 'Soft Ember' theme for investor credibility..."
  - Calls `theme_selector_tool`
  - Applies professional design
- Agent: "Deck complete. Would you like to adjust anything?"
  - Remembers all context
  - Can refine individual slides without starting over

### Key Benefits

**1. Accuracy**
- Uses real data from tools (not hallucinations)
- Validates facts before including them
- Cites sources for credibility

**2. Intelligence**
- Understands startup context (stage, industry, market)
- Asks clarifying questions when needed
- Suggests improvements based on best practices

**3. Efficiency**
- Works autonomously once given context
- Handles research, writing, design in parallel
- Iterates until deck is perfect

**4. Personalization**
- Remembers your startup's unique story
- Adapts tone for target audience (investors vs. demo day)
- Learns from feedback on previous decks
