## üöÄ CORE FEATURES & USE CASES

### 1. AI Presentation Generator

3. User reviews/edits outline
4. AI generates full slides with text + images
5. User customizes theme, fonts, colors
6. Present or export

**Real-world example**:
> **Startup Founder - Mar√≠a**: "I'm pitching to investors next week. I have market data but struggle with design. I enter 'AgTech startup pitch deck for Colombian market' ‚Üí AI generates 12 slides with problem/solution/market analysis ‚Üí I tweak numbers ‚Üí Beautiful pitch deck ready in 90 seconds."
