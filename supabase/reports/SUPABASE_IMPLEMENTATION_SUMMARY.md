## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Before Audit (Grade: C+)

| Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Dangerous rollback in migrations | Critical | Could delete all data |
| Venues open to all users | Critical | Spam/vandalism risk |
| Counter functions without SECURITY DEFINER | High | Incorrect counts |
| is_owner() without validation | High | SQL injection risk |
| All candidates visible to all | High | Privacy violation |
| All companies visible to all | High | Competitor harvesting |

### After Fixes (Grade: B+)

| Fix | Implementation | Verification |
|-----|----------------|--------------|
| Rollback script moved | supabase/rollback_scripts/ | ✅ Not in migrations/ |
| Venues restricted | Admin-only INSERT/DELETE | ✅ Policies verified |
| Counter functions secured | SECURITY DEFINER + search_path | ✅ Functions verified |
| is_owner() validated | Table/column whitelists | ✅ Code inspection passed |
| Candidates scoped | Own + applied jobs only | ✅ Policies verified |
| Companies gated | published=true required | ✅ Column and policies verified |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Production Launch

1. **Auth Integration**
   - [ ] Create test user via Supabase Auth
   - [ ] Verify profile created automatically (or via app)
   - [ ] Test has_role('admin') with admin user

2. **Counter Accuracy**
   - [ ] Create event
   - [ ] Add registration
   - [ ] Verify registered_count incremented
   - [ ] Cancel registration
   - [ ] Verify registered_count decremented

3. **Venues Security**
   - [ ] Try creating venue as non-admin (should fail)
   - [ ] Create venue as admin (should succeed)
   - [ ] Verify created_by populated

4. **Candidates Privacy**
   - [ ] As user A, create candidate profile
   - [ ] As user B, try viewing user A's profile (should fail)
   - [ ] User A applies to user B's job
   - [ ] User B views user A's profile (should succeed)

5. **Companies Visibility**
   - [ ] Create company with published=false
   - [ ] Verify not visible to public/other users
   - [ ] Set published=true
   - [ ] Verify visible to public

### Recommended Load Testing

```sql
-- Test counter performance under load
DO $$
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..1000 LOOP
    INSERT INTO registrations (event_id, profile_id, status)
    VALUES ('test-event', gen_random_uuid(), 'confirmed');
  END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Verify count is accurate
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM registrations WHERE event_id = 'test-event') as actual,
  (SELECT registered_count FROM events WHERE id = 'test-event') as cached;
-- Should match exactly
```

## 🎓 Best Practices Implemented

### ✅ Security

- SECURITY DEFINER on functions that bypass RLS
- search_path protection on all SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Input validation whitelists on dynamic SQL
- Least-privilege RLS policies (own, admin, public scoped separately)
- Soft delete pattern (deleted_at instead of hard delete)

### ✅ Performance

- Indexes on all foreign keys
- Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Partial indexes for filtered queries (published=true, deleted_at IS NULL)
- Trigger-based denormalization (counters)

### ✅ Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE/SET NULL
- Check constraints for validation
- Unique constraints for slugs
- NOT NULL on required fields
- Default values for timestamps and booleans

### ✅ Maintainability

- Comprehensive comments on functions and policies
- Idempotent migrations (IF NOT EXISTS, ON CONFLICT)
- Structured migration naming (timestamp + description)
- Separated concerns (extensions, schema, indexes, functions, RLS)

## 🔧 Operational Procedures

### Backup Strategy

**Supabase Automatic Backups:**
- Daily backups (Pro plan)
- 7-day retention
- PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) available

**Manual Backup:**
```bash
# Full database dump
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Specific tables only
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL -t events -t registrations > critical_backup.sql
```

### Disaster Recovery

1. Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups
2. Select restore point (date/time)
3. Click "Restore" (creates new project)
4. Update application environment variables to new project URL
5. Test application connectivity
6. Update DNS/CDN if applicable

**RPO:** 24 hours (daily backups)
**RTO:** 4 hours (manual restore + app config)

### Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Counter accuracy (registered_count vs actual)
- Profile creation success rate
- RLS policy performance
- Failed auth attempts
- Unusual data access patterns

**Set Up Alerts For:**
- Counter drift > 5% from actual
- Profile creation failures
- is_owner() warnings (invalid table/column)
- Unauthorized modification attempts
